# Storm ORM Documentation

Welcome to Storm ORM - a modern C++26 ORM library using compile-time reflection to automatically map C++ structs to database tables without macros.

**Supported backends**: SQLite, PostgreSQL

## Quick Links

- **[Benchmarks](https://github.com/spiritEcosse/storm/blob/develop/benchmarks/README.md)** - Performance results and benchmark system

## Guide

Documentation for users of Storm ORM — patterns, features, and field/migration reference.

### Cookbook
