# Storm ORM Documentation

Welcome to Storm ORM - a modern C++26 ORM library for SQLite using cutting-edge reflection to automatically map C++ structs to database tables.

## Quick Links

## Features

### Core Operations
- **[CRUD Operations](features/CRUD_OPERATIONS.md)** - INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE with auto-generated IDs
- **[SELECT Queries](features/SELECT_QUERIES.md)** - Optimized row extraction and statement caching
- **[WHERE Clauses](features/WHERE_CLAUSES.md)** - Type-safe filtering with pure C++26 reflection
- **[JOIN Operations](features/JOIN_OPERATIONS.md)** - Single and multi-FK JOINs with type erasure
- **[Batch Operations](features/BATCH_OPERATIONS.md)** - Bulk INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE with smart thresholds

## Performance Summary

Storm ORM achieves **1.5-6x performance advantage** over sqlite_orm:

| Operation | Storm ORM | Raw SQLite | Storm vs sqlite_orm |
|-----------|-----------|------------|---------------------|
| INSERT (single) | 992K/sec | 49M/sec | 2.0x faster |
| INSERT (batch) | 2.7M/sec | - | 6.4x faster |
| SELECT (all rows) | 13.07M rows/sec | 17.67M rows/sec | 1.51x faster |
| UPDATE (single) | 2M/sec (12M peak) | 1.09M/sec | 6x faster |
| DELETE (single) | 21.6M/sec | 29.4M/sec | 36.6x faster |
| DELETE (batch) | 3.9M/sec | - | - |
| JOIN | 4-6M rows/sec | 5-7.4M rows/sec | 77% avg efficiency |
| WHERE | 9.45-11.88M rows/sec | 10.57-13.82M rows/sec | 86-90% efficiency |

## Key Innovations

1. **Compile-Time SQL Generation** - Zero runtime SQL construction overhead
2. **3-Level Statement Caching** - QuerySet → Statement → Connection caching
3. **Thread-Local SQL Caching** - 8-entry cache for bulk operations
4. **Optimized Row Extraction** - resize() pre-allocation, direct string construction
5. **Type-Erased JOIN Pattern** - Abstract base class pattern without std::function
6. **Pure C++26 Reflection WHERE** - No macros, fully module-compatible

## TODO:
- [ ] Replace all std::vector with plf::hive
- [ ] Lets think how to add true sttistics in README files (like benchmarks)
- [ ] **Batch INSERT Performance Variance** - Small batch operations (batch_10) show high measurement variance (72-88% efficiency range across runs). This is expected for very small operations due to:
  - Cold cache effects (first-run overhead)
  - Timer precision at microsecond scale
  - CPU frequency scaling

  **Example benchmark run** (batch_10, 1000 iterations):
  ```
  Storm ORM:   1.61 M ops/sec (10000 operations in 6209.29 μs)
  Raw SQLite:  1.95 M ops/sec (10000 operations in 5122.02 μs)
  Efficiency:  82.5% (slower than raw SQLite)
  ```

  **Recommendation**: For accurate batch performance assessment:
  - Run multiple iterations (5-10 runs minimum)
  - Calculate average efficiency
  - Focus on larger batch sizes (100+) for stable measurements
  - Small batches (<50) will always show ±10-15% variance
