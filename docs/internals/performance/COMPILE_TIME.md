# Compile-Time Analysis

Where Storm's build time actually goes, measured rather than assumed, and what
moves it. All numbers below are measurements on a 4-core dev container
(clang-p2996, `ninja-debug` unless stated), reproducible with the methods in
[Method](#method).

**Summary**: the build is dominated by the ~110 hand-written test TUs, not by
the YAML-driven test corpus. Each test TU used to pay a **~5.8 s fixed floor**
before its first assertion, **entirely frontend** — Backend is 0.03 s. The gtest
PCH removed most of that floor; what survives it is measured in
[After the PCH](#after-the-pch-issue-633).

---

## Where the time goes

Object compiles only, ninja edges deduplicated (a C++ module edge emits both
`.pcm` and `.o` and must be counted once):

| bucket | files | sec | % | avg |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| hand-written test TUs | 110 | 2558 | **85.2%** | 23.3s |
| storm library modules | 35 | 216 | 7.2% | 6.2s |
| YAML corpus TUs | 4 | 159 | **5.3%** | 39.7s |
| mock test binaries | 6 | 54 | 1.8% | 9.0s |

Total ≈ **3003 s** of compile CPU. Release is ~32% more expensive again (3954 s)
despite Debug carrying coverage instrumentation — `-O2` over this much template
instantiation costs more than the instrumentation does.

By test directory: `query/` 42.6%, `schema/` 24.3%, `crud/` 19.3%, `yaml/` 6.2%.

That table is the **baseline**, before any of [What was fixed](#what-was-fixed) —
its 23.3 s average per test TU is the pre-PCH figure, when each TU still paid the
5.8 s floor below.

### Re-measured after #634 (2026-09-08)

Everything above is arithmetic from that baseline minus per-change deltas. This
is an actual whole-build measurement of the current tree, so the two can be
compared for *shape* — but **not** subtracted for a saving: it is a different
machine, and the doc's own rule applies (read the deltas within a section, not
absolute seconds across sections).

Method exactly as in [Method](#method): `rm -rf build/debug`, configure + build
`ninja-debug` to completion, then parse `.ninja_log` deduplicating on
`(start, end, cmdhash)`. Object compiles only — the 217 module-scan edges
(`.ddi`/`.dd`/`.modmap`, 48 s together) are excluded, as they are above.

| bucket | files | sec | % | avg |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| hand-written test TUs | 110 | 1518 | **73.8%** | 13.8s |
| storm library modules | 71 | 342 | 16.6% | 4.8s |
| YAML corpus TUs | 5 | 104 | 5.1% | 20.9s |
| mock test binaries | 8 | 62 | 3.0% | 7.8s |
| other (gtest PCH, tools, deps) | 5 | 32 | 1.5% | 6.3s |

Total **2059 s** of object-compile CPU over 199 edges, **397 s wall** (≈5.2x
effective parallelism on 4 cores). The test-TU count matches the baseline's 110
exactly, which is what makes the rows comparable; the `storm library modules`
row does not — 71 here counts the 37 synthesized-module BMI edges the baseline's
35 (`.cppm` files only) leaves out.

**Host for this measurement** — recorded because the baseline's is not, and the
absolute seconds mean nothing without it:

| | |
|---|---|
| CPU | Intel Xeon @ 2.80 GHz, **4 vCPU** |
| RAM | 16 GB |
| kernel / host OS | Linux 6.18.44-fc-v24, Ubuntu 24.04.4 LTS (sandboxed microVM) |
| disk | virtio `/dev/vda`, ext4 |
| container | `docker/ci/Dockerfile` (Manjaro base) via `scripts/dev-container.sh` |
| compiler | clang-p2996 21.0.0git, commit `9ffb96e3` |
| cmake / ninja | 4.4.3 / 1.13.2 (default `-j`, i.e. 6 jobs on 4 cores) |
| preset | `ninja-debug` (coverage instrumentation on) |
| tree | commit `27c0f0f` (#634 landed) |

Do **not** read `3003 -> 2059` as a 31% win. The changes in
[What was fixed](#what-was-fixed) sum to roughly -350 to -450 s; the rest of the
gap is hardware. Attributing it properly needs the baseline re-run on this same
host, which has not been done.

## The per-TU floor

This is the **pre-PCH** floor — the measurement that motivated precompiling
gtest. Probe TUs whose entire body is `int p(){return 0;}` (min of 3 runs each,
warm):

| probe | sec | delta |
|---|---:|---|
| empty | 0.0 | — |
| `#include <gtest/gtest.h>` | 2.2 | **+2.2** |
| + `import std;` | 2.4 | +0.2 |
| + `import storm;` | 4.3 | **+2.1** |
| + `test_db_helpers.h` + `shared/models.h` (the pre-#634 umbrella) | 5.8 | **+1.4** |

`-ftime-trace` on a TU containing one `EXPECT_TRUE(true)`: Frontend 6.28 s,
**Backend 0.03 s**. Parsing (`Source`) is 3.09 s of it; the rest is 448 function
and 1197 class instantiations, in a file that instantiates nothing of its own.

Two counter-intuitive results worth keeping:

- **A module import is nearly free until something uses it.** `import std;` and
  `import storm;` in isolation measure 0.0 s — BMI loading is lazy. The 2.1 s
  above appears only *alongside* gtest: the cost is reconciling storm's BMI
  against the textual libc++ declarations gtest drags in, not deserialising the
  BMI as such.
- **Inside storm, the cost is concentrated.** Over the gtest baseline:
  `storm_db_sqlite` +0.0 s, `storm_orm_utilities` +0.2 s,
  `storm_orm_statements_join` +0.8 s, `storm_orm_schema` +1.0 s,
  **`storm_orm_queryset` +1.6 s** — of a +2.1 s total for the umbrella `storm`.

  The second of these is an artefact of the empty probe body and does **not**
  survive re-measurement — see [After the PCH](#after-the-pch-issue-633).

## After the PCH (issue #633)

Numbers in this section are from a **different, faster host** than the rest of
the document (gtest alone: 1.65 s here vs 2.2 s above), so read the deltas, not
the absolute seconds.

Precompiling gtest did not only remove gtest's own share of the floor. It
removed most of `import storm;` with it, which is exactly what the causal story
above predicts — once gtest arrives already serialised, there are no textual
libc++ declarations left to reconcile against:

| probe (body `int p(){return 0;}`) | textual gtest | gtest via PCH |
|---|---:|---:|
| gtest | 1.65 | 0.04 |
| + `import std;` | 1.72 | 0.05 |
| + `import storm;` | 3.10 | 0.29 |
| **cost of `import storm;`** | **+1.38** | **+0.24** |

An empty body understates it, because declarations come out of the PCH lazily
and a probe that never mentions `EXPECT_*` never pulls them. With a body that
uses gtest for real, all three variants via the PCH:

| body | no storm | + `import storm;` | delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `EXPECT_TRUE(true)` | 0.14 | 0.65 | +0.51 |
| strings + vectors | 0.25 | 0.99 | +0.74 |
| `TYPED_TEST` | 0.23 | 1.02 | +0.79 |
| strings + vectors, textual gtest | 1.82 | 3.31 | +1.49 |

So the surviving cost of `import storm;` is **+0.5 to +0.8 s per TU**, scaling
with how much gtest the TU uses — roughly **55-90 s** over the suite, not the
~230 s that issue #633 was opened against.

### What that residual actually is

`-ftime-trace` on `import storm_orm_queryset;` against a gtest-only baseline,
same body, `-ftime-trace-granularity=0`. Of the +0.63 s:

| bucket | delta |
|---|---:|
| `ParseDeclarationOrFunctionDefinition` | +0.29 |
| `PerformPendingInstantiations` | +0.16 |
| `CodeGen Function` + `DebugType` | +0.18 |
| `InstantiateFunction` + `InstantiateClass` | +0.18 |
| `ReadAST` + `Module Load` + `Load External Specializations` | **+0.06-0.10** |

Reading the BMI is under a sixth of it. The rest is **gtest's own
instantiations getting slower**. The heaviest entries with storm imported are,
in order, `testing::internal::CmpHelperEQ`, `EqHelper::Compare`,
`PrintToString`, `UniversalPrint`, and `std::__can_be_converted_to_string_view` /
`std::is_convertible` — gtest and libc++ templates. **No storm declaration
appears anywhere in the top instantiations.**

The mechanism, then, is not that storm is expensive to load. It is that storm's
declarations join the lookup set, and every later template instantiation in the
TU pays for the larger set. That single fact predicts every other result here:
the cost tracks gtest usage rather than storm usage; `storm_orm_queryset`'s own
body costs ~0; putting `import storm;` in the PCH makes things *worse*; and
narrowing what a module exports cannot help, because the cost is in the set
existing, not in what is reachable through it.

It also scales with the size of the declaration set added, not merely with the
act of importing — leaf modules are genuinely free. Over a gtest-only baseline
of 0.24 s, with a real gtest body:

| import | sec | delta |
|---|---:|---:|
| `storm_db_concept`, `storm_db_sqlite`, `storm_orm_generator`, `storm_orm_transaction` | 0.25-0.27 | ~0.00 |
| `storm_orm_where`, `storm_orm_fields`, `storm_orm_statements_orderby` | 0.35-0.41 | +0.10-0.16 |
| `storm_orm_statements_base` | 0.49 | +0.25 |
| `storm_orm_statements_select` | 0.59 | +0.35 |
| **queryset's own imports, without `storm_orm_queryset`** | **0.91** | **+0.67** |
| `storm_orm_queryset` | 0.88 | +0.64 |
| `storm` (umbrella) | 0.95 | +0.71 |

The decisive row is the second-to-last: importing everything
`storm_orm_queryset` imports, but *not* `storm_orm_queryset` itself, costs the
same as importing it. Its own content contributes nothing measurable. The
umbrella adds only +0.07 s on top of it, so even a perfectly narrowed umbrella
is worth ~8 s over the suite.

## The YAML corpus is not the problem

It registers **494 of the suite's 3093 tests (16%) for 5.3% of compile time**.
Inside the heaviest of its four TUs (36.5 s), `-ftime-trace` splits as: template
instantiation ~55%, codegen ~20%, and the consteval JSON parsing that the corpus
is often blamed for — `EvaluateAsConstantExpr` 1.6 s + `EvaluateAsInitializer`
2.8 s — **~5-8%**.

Per registered test the corpus costs 0.32 s against ~0.98 s for hand-written
tests, but that comparison is confounded: hand-written TUs pay the fixed floor
110 times and test structurally heavier things. The honest statement is that the
whole question is bounded by ~160 s in either direction, so **compile time is not
a good reason to keep or drop the corpus**.

Note that the cost driver is the number of *distinct compile-time queries*, not
the corpus format. Hand-porting the same cases pays the same instantiation.

## What was tried and rejected

Each of these looked promising and was killed by measurement.

### ccache — safe, but the BMIs are not byte-reproducible

Measured twice, with opposite conclusions. The second measurement (ccache
**4.14**, issue #630) supersedes the first, which is kept below only to say why
it was wrong. The ccache version the first round used was not recorded, but the
difference is methodological, not a version difference — see there.

Test TUs cache beautifully: 8.8 s → **0.13 s**, 100% cacheable, direct hit.
`.cppm` compiles are 100% uncacheable (`unsupported_source_language:
c++-module`) and fall through at no cost, so the 85% of build time that lives
in the ~110 test TUs is the part in play. Two preconditions:

- `CCACHE_SLOPPINESS=pch_defines,time_macros` is **mandatory** — without it the
  gtest PCH makes every test TU uncacheable (`Result:
  could_not_use_precompiled_header`), reported as a flat 0% cacheable with no
  other explanation.
- The launcher must not reach `.cppm` compiles expecting hits; it costs nothing
  but never returns any.

**ccache 4.14 is module-aware and safe here.** Its log shows `Hashing module
file …bmi` for every BMI in CMake's `.modmap`, so a rebuilt module interface
changes the cache key. The `#embed` corpus is covered too, by a different
route: direct mode misses on those 4 TUs (`direct_cache_miss`) and ccache falls
back to running the preprocessor, whose output carries the embedded bytes
(`preprocessed_cache_hit`). Mutating `unified_cases_select.json` correctly
produced a miss.

**What kills it is that BMIs are not byte-reproducible.** Two back-to-back
`--precompile` runs of the same untouched `src/storm.cppm` differ in content
*and in size* (14,933,024 vs 14,933,008 bytes; the first difference is a
~20-byte signature region at offset 11860). `-Xclang -fno-pch-timestamp` does
not help. Because ccache hashes the BMI bytes, **every BMI rebuild permanently
invalidates every downstream test-TU entry**. On 5 test TUs:

| scenario | hits | wall |
|---|---:|---:|
| objects deleted, BMIs untouched | 5/5 | 125 ms |
| `touch` 2 module sources (content identical), BMIs rebuilt | 0/5 | 30.7 s |
| same churn again | 0/5 | 29.9 s |
| objects deleted, BMIs untouched again | 5/5 | 152 ms |

So hits occur exactly while the BMIs on disk are unchanged, which excludes
every workflow that motivates a compiler cache: `rm -rf build`, a fresh
worktree (which the branching rules mandate per branch, and which also moves
the source paths), a CI run in a fresh container, and any branch switch
touching `src/`. What remains is a branch flip or `git stash pop` touching
**only** `tests/` — real, but narrow. Not wired in.

The upstream dependency worth watching is **clang BMI reproducibility**, not
ccache's module support. Any compiler cache that hashes BMIs inherits this;
one that does not hash them is unsafe. `sccache` was not measured.

#### The superseded first round

The earlier round concluded "ccache does not hash the BMIs a TU imports" from
this observation — editing `src/orm/queryset.cppm` and recompiling a test TU
through ccache returns a HIT with a byte-identical object:

```
before editing the module : md5=7a7510190425  hits=1
after  editing the module : md5=7a7510190425  hits=2
```

That reproduces on 4.14, and is **not** a stale hit. It only appears when the
TU's command line is replayed directly, without letting ninja rebuild the BMI
first — and against an unchanged BMI on disk, that object is exactly what a
cacheless clang would produce. Driven through ninja, the BMI is rebuilt before
its dependents and ccache misses (row 2 of the table above). The `#embed` half
of that finding is likewise obsolete, per the preprocessed-mode fallback above.

### UNITY_BUILD — mutually exclusive with module scanning

CMake **silently** disables `UNITY_BUILD` whenever `CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES` is ON,
with no warning:

```
CMAKE_CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES=OFF -> "Unity" edges in build.ninja: 4
CMAKE_CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES=ON  -> "Unity" edges in build.ninja: 0
```

Scanning cannot be turned off for these TUs, because a TU with `import std;` and
`CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES OFF` fails with `fatal error: module 'std' not found` — no
module map is generated for it.

### `extern template` — no effect on time

It works mechanically (object 10.9 MB → 10.2 MB, symbols 8404 → 7736) but does
not move compile time, because it suppresses codegen and codegen is 0.03 s of the
floor. An early "-47%" reading was a cold-cache artifact of the first compile in
a session; with warm caches and min-of-3 the effect is zero or slightly negative.

### `import storm;` inside the PCH — a regression, not a win (#633)

The obvious follow-up to precompiling gtest is to precompile the storm import
alongside it, paying the reconciliation once instead of ~110 times. It is
mechanically possible and measurably worse.

CMake does not scan the PCH source for module imports — its
`compile_commands.json` entry carries no `@...modmap` — so the PCH build fails
outright with `fatal error: module 'std' not found`. Appending a real test TU's
modmap by hand gets it to build, and then:

| PCH contents | PCH build | TU (strings) | TU (`TYPED_TEST`) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| gtest only (shipping) | 2.15 | **1.00** | **1.01** |
| gtest, then `import storm;` | 8.07 | 1.27 | 1.31 |
| `import storm;`, then gtest | **compile error** | — | — |

Every TU gets **0.27-0.30 s slower**, which follows directly from the mechanism
above: the import does not amortise, it enlarges the lookup set that the PCH's
own contents are then resolved against. Importing storm *before* gtest does not
compile at all — the same textual-libc++-versus-module clash that already forces
four groups of files onto `SKIP_PRECOMPILE_HEADERS` in `tests/CMakeLists.txt`.

Folding the other lever's headers in fails the same way: a PCH of gtest +
`import storm;` + `test_db_helpers.h` + `test_models.h` dies on
`test_db_helpers.h`'s global-module forward declaration of
`storm::db::sqlite::Connection` (`declaration of 'Connection' in the global
module follows declaration in module storm_db_sqlite`). Dropping storm and
precompiling `test_db_helpers.h` alone — the half that needs no storm import —
breaks 3 of 4 sampled TUs inside libc++'s `<format>`
(`call to implicitly-deleted default constructor of 'formatter<...>'`), and the
one TU that still compiles is +0.08 s. So the ~150 s `test_db_helpers.h` lever
is **not** reachable by extending the PCH.

### Narrowing `storm_orm_queryset`'s exports (#633)

Issue #633's second proposed direction. There is nothing to narrow: importing
`storm_orm_queryset`'s dependency list *without* `storm_orm_queryset` costs
+0.67 s against +0.64 s for the module itself. The facade's own content is free;
the cost is the transitive surface a QuerySet consumer needs regardless.

### Tests importing submodules instead of the umbrella (#633)

Issue #633's first proposed direction. It works and it is small.

Of the ~110 test TUs, **9** import `storm` without needing
`storm_orm_queryset` — every other TU reaches `storm::QuerySet` through
`tests/test_models.h`'s fixtures. Three of the nine cannot be converted anyway:
`schema/test_valid_foreign_key_concept.cpp` and `query/test_fields_selector.cpp`
spell `storm::primary`, and `schema/test_dialect_concepts.cpp` calls
`storm::begin` — names that exist only in the umbrella (`storm::primary` is
#442's top-level re-export; converting would mean reverting those tests to
`storm::meta::`).

The remaining six, replayed with their own commands from
`compile_commands.json`:

| TU | `import storm;` | submodules | delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `schema/test_stitch_key.cpp` | 1.47 | 0.45 | −1.02 |
| `schema/test_valid_field_info_concept.cpp` | 0.96 | 0.37 | −0.60 |
| `schema/test_bindable_concept.cpp` | 3.27 | 1.90 | −1.37 |
| `db/test_statement_move.cpp` | 0.84 | 0.21 | −0.63 |
| `db/test_cache_invalidation.cpp` | 2.44 | 1.21 | −1.23 |
| `db/test_sqlite_tuning.cpp` | 4.98 | 2.94 | −2.04 |
| **total** | **13.97** | **7.08** | **−6.89** |

−6.9 s of ~3000 s (0.2%), in exchange for six test files naming internal module
names. Not adopted. `errors/test_error_construction.cpp` and
`yaml/test_init_dataset_size.cpp` already import submodules directly, so the
option remains open per-file if a TU ever needs it.

### Dropping the second backend from `TYPED_TEST`

Every `TYPED_TEST` over `DatabaseTypes` instantiates its body twice, once per
backend, which looks like an obvious 2x. It is not: measured by compiling real
TUs as-is, then again with `DatabaseTypes` narrowed to SQLite alone (bodies
untouched, min of 3, ccache off).

| TU | 2 backends | 1 backend | delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `schema/test_types.cpp` | 20.45 | 16.53 | **−19.2%** |
| `query/test_distinct.cpp` | 17.11 | 15.00 | −12.3% |
| `crud/test_conditional_update.cpp` | 13.75 | 11.57 | −15.8% |
| `query/test_sql_verify.cpp` | 12.10 | 10.52 | −13.1% |
| `query/test_collate.cpp` (control) | 12.10 | 12.21 | +0.9% |
| **total** | **75.51** | **65.83** | **−12.8%** |

`test_collate.cpp` is the control: it declares `SqliteTypes`, not
`DatabaseTypes`, so the edit could not reach it. Its +0.9% is the noise floor,
which puts the other four comfortably in signal.

So the second backend costs **~13%**, not ~50% — the two instantiations share
most of their work. Over the 2558 s the hand-written test TUs cost, that is
~330 s of a ~3000 s build (~11%): the largest single lever measured so far, and
the only one still available at that size.

**Not adopted, and not recommended.** It buys ~11% by deleting the PostgreSQL
half of the suite's coverage — the thing cross-backend tests exist for, and
which CLAUDE.md requires for exactly the failure class (SQLite and PG disagree
about what is an error) that composite-PK and FK work keeps hitting. Recorded
here so the trade is known and nobody has to re-measure it: the coverage is
cheap, at 13% of test compile time.

### Replacing GoogleTest — poor return

The ceiling is gtest's 2.2 s, but any framework includes standard headers
textually, so the +2.1 s storm/libc++ reconciliation stays regardless. That
ceiling is available from a PCH instead, without rewriting 3093 tests.

---

## What was fixed

| change | effect |
|---|---|
| removed dead `create_table_sql` globals from `tests/test_models.h` (referenced by nothing, but forced full consteval schema generation in all 89 including TUs) | −0.7 s/TU ≈ **−62 s** |
| `#embed` corpora declared as real build inputs (`OBJECT_DEPENDS`) | correctness |
| precompiled `<gtest/gtest.h>` for `storm_tests` | −2.15 s/TU ≈ **−220 s** (understated — see below) |
| `run_clang_tidy.sh --diff` no longer reports a crashed clang-tidy as a clean pass | correctness |
| split `shared/models.h` + `tests/test_models.h` so a TU pulls only the models and helpers it uses (#634) | −0.67 s/TU ≈ **−64 s** |

≈ **−344 s of ~3000 s (−11%)** — a sum of per-change deltas, not a measured
total. For an actual whole-build number on the current tree (with the host it
was taken on, which this baseline lacks), see
[Re-measured after #634](#re-measured-after-634-2026-09-08).

The gtest PCH row understates what it bought. It was measured as the removal of
gtest's own share of the floor, but it also took most of `import storm;` with it
— +1.38 s per TU down to +0.24-0.79 s, roughly another 100 s — because the
reconciliation it removes is between storm's BMI and gtest's *textual* libc++
declarations. See [After the PCH](#after-the-pch-issue-633).

### Splitting `shared/models.h` per model (#634) — rejected on probes, adopted on measurement

Issue #634's proposal: every test TU parses 12 models and generates 49
field-selector proxies to use one, so give each model its own header. Measured
after the gtest PCH landed, on the same host as
[After the PCH](#after-the-pch-issue-633). Baseline **B** is
`gtest(PCH) + import storm; + import std; + test_db_helpers.h`; probes add a
generated header carrying the first N model structs and their `fields::` blocks.

The header block is genuinely expensive — more so than #634 measured, because the
PCH shrank everything around it:

| probe (empty body) | sec | Δ over B |
|---|---:|---:|
| A — without `test_db_helpers.h` | 0.40 | — |
| **B** — baseline | 0.49 | +0.09 |
| B + 1 model, no `fields::` proxy | 1.10 | +0.65 |
| B + 11 models, no proxies | 1.48 | +1.03 |
| **B + 1 model + its proxy** | **2.09** | **+1.64** |
| B + 3 models + 3 proxies | 2.11 | +1.66 |
| B + 5 models + 5 proxies | 2.42 | +1.97 |
| B + 7 models + 6 proxies | 2.54 | +2.09 |
| **B + 11 models + 6 proxies** | **2.59** | **+2.14** |
| B + full `shared/models.h` (12 + seed arrays) | 2.69 | +2.20 |
| B + full `test_models.h` (+ helpers, fixture) | 3.19 | +2.70 |

**The cost is an intercept, not a slope.** The first model and its first proxy
cost +1.64 s; the other ten models and five proxies together cost +0.50 s, about
0.05 s each. Split finer: the first annotated struct is +0.65 s, the first
`define_aggregate` + `FieldRef`/`Field` proxy is +0.99 s, each subsequent struct
~0.04 s, each subsequent proxy ~0.02 s. The seed arrays (`PEOPLE_25`,
`MESSAGES_8`) are +0.06 s — not worth moving.

Since every test TU needs at least one model, a per-model split cannot touch the
intercept. It can only recover the slope, and only for TUs that need one model.

**With a real body it recovers even less.** The probes above have trivial bodies;
a real TU calls `QuerySet<Person>` and `fields::Person`, which instantiates the
same machinery the intercept pays for. Same probes, body one `where().order_by()
.limit().select()` plus a `count().execute()`:

| probe (real body) | sec |
|---|---:|
| 1 model | 6.55 |
| 11 models | 6.88 |
| full `shared/models.h` | 7.15 |
| full `test_models.h` | 6.87 |

**~0.3-0.6 s on a ~6.9 s TU**, and note that full `test_models.h` measured
*below* full `shared/models.h` despite being a strict superset — the noise floor
at this magnitude is ~0.3 s, the same size as the effect. Extrapolated over the
89 including TUs that projects roughly **30 s of a ~3000 s build (~1%)**, against
#634's estimate of ~150 s.

The mechanism is the same one [After the PCH](#after-the-pch-issue-633) found for
`import storm;`: the cost is *entering* the reflection machinery, not the volume
pulled through it. `test_db_helpers.h`, which #634's title names alongside the
models, is +0.09 s and was never the problem.

#### What the probes missed, and why the split shipped anyway

Those probes vary only the *model* content, so they answer "how much do the
other eleven models cost" and not "how much does the umbrella cost". Two things
the split removes are outside what they varied:

Counts used below, since the earlier text says 89: **82 files** named
`test_models.h` at HEAD (81 TUs plus the umbrella's own usage example), and
**97 compilation units** reached `shared/models.h` through their include
closure — the extra 15 arrive via shared body headers. 97 is the denominator
for the extrapolation.

- **The helper block.** `make_record`/`make_updated_record`/`is_original_record`
  and `populate_join_test_data` are used by 2 and 2 TUs respectively, but every
  TU parsed them. The probe table above prices helpers+fixture together at
  +0.50 s and never separates them; the fixture is what almost every TU actually
  wanted.
- **TUs that need no shared model at all.** 14 of the 97 declare their own
  models and used the umbrella purely for `StormTestFixture`.

Measured A/B on the real tree rather than on probes — same host, same BMIs, the
split stashed and unstashed between runs, min of 3 after a warm-up, ccache off:

| TU | shared models it needs | before | after | Δ |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `db/test_pool.cpp` | Person | 7.02 | 5.64 | **−1.38** |
| `schema/test_ddl_execution_audit.cpp` | all 11 | 38.77 | 37.47 | **−1.30** |
| `crud/test_select.cpp` | Person | 11.45 | 10.31 | −1.14 |
| `schema/test_max_length.cpp` | none | 8.07 | 7.11 | −0.96 |
| `schema/test_types.cpp` | 7 | 23.90 | 23.14 | −0.76 |
| `schema/test_short_annotations.cpp` | none | 6.22 | 5.66 | −0.56 |
| `query/test_many_to_many_sqlite.cpp` | none | 10.99 | 10.64 | −0.35 |
| `query/test_where_temporal.cpp` | ExtendedTypes | 13.52 | 13.26 | −0.26 |
| `query/test_where.cpp` | 3 + seed array | 14.61 | 14.68 | +0.07 |

The decisive row is `test_ddl_execution_audit.cpp`. It needs *every* model, so
the per-model split cannot help it, and it still gained 1.30 s — that is the
helper block alone. **The intercept finding stands; it was just not the whole
cost.** Adopted on that basis, not on the per-model slope.

That row was measured with the audit TU on per-model includes. It **ships on the
umbrella instead**, deliberately: it is the only TU that wants every model, and
making it the umbrellas' one consumer is what keeps `test_models.h` and
`shared/models.h` compiled at all — a header nothing includes is never parsed and
rots silently. So its 1.30 s is given back on purpose, and the shipped saving is
the other eight rows:

mean **−0.67 s/TU**, median −0.66, 7 of 8 negative — ≈ **−64 s** over the 96
remaining TUs. Still about 2x what the probes projected, and the same magnitude
as the `create_table_sql` removal already in [What was fixed](#what-was-fixed).

### Two correctness bugs found along the way

**`#embed` is invisible to the dependency scanner.** Clang does not list an
embedded file in the depfile, so ninja recorded no edge from the consuming object
to the JSON (`ninja -t deps` showed none). Editing `unified_cases.yaml`
regenerated the JSON and left the objects stale — the suite kept running the
previous corpus, green. The benchmark corpus had the identical bug.

**A crashed clang-tidy read as success.** `--diff` counted only `": error:"` and
`": warning:"` lines, and a SIGSEGV prints neither. `--full` already treated an
unexpected crash as failure; `--diff` did not.

### A build-state trap worth recognising

If a build is interrupted (Ctrl-C, OOM kill, a killed CI job), ninja's
`.ninja_deps` can be left truncated. Every subsequent build then prints

```
ninja: warning: premature end of file; recovering
```

and rebuilds the whole `import storm;` dependency graph despite unchanged
sources — indistinguishable from "compilation is just slow". `ninja -t recompact`
followed by **one build that runs to completion uninterrupted** restores true
incremental behaviour (verified: the next build was `no work to do`, 0 s).

## Remaining levers

| lever | ceiling | note |
|---|---:|---|
| ~~`import storm;` per TU~~ | ~~230 s~~ | **Closed by measurement (#633).** The gtest PCH already took it from +1.38 s to +0.5-0.8 s per TU. What remains is gtest's own instantiations slowing down because storm's declarations are in the lookup set — not storm being loaded — so it is not reachable from storm's side. Both directions #633 proposed were measured and rejected above; together they are worth ~15 s. |
| ~~`test_db_helpers.h` + `shared/models.h`~~ | ~~150 s~~ | **Done (#634), for ~half the reason the issue gave.** The model cost is an *intercept* — the first model and its first `fields::` proxy are +1.64 s, the other eleven models +0.50 s — so the per-model split reaches only the slope. What made it worth doing is the part the probes bundled in with the models: the helper block every TU parsed for 2 TUs' benefit, and the 14 TUs that need no shared model at all. Measured **−0.67 s/TU ≈ −64 s** as shipped, not the ~150 s estimated nor the ~30 s the probes projected. `test_db_helpers.h` itself is +0.09 s and was never the problem. See [above](#splitting-sharedmodelsh-per-model-634--rejected-on-probes-adopted-on-measurement). |
| the reflection intercept itself | unmeasured | What the row above leaves on the table: ~1.6 s per TU to enter the machinery (first annotated struct +0.65 s, first `define_aggregate`/`FieldRef` proxy +0.99 s). Library-side, so it would benefit users and not only tests — but it is the cost of the reflection a querying TU needs anyway, so whether *any* of it is removable is unknown. Measure before opening it as work. |

## Method

- **Per-TU timing**: replay a TU's exact command from `compile_commands.json`
  with `-o` stripped, serially, min of 3 runs. Timing through `ninja` instead adds
  the scan step and roughly ±2 s of noise; the replay harness holds ±0.1-0.3 s.
- **Always disable ccache when timing.** `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER` set with
  `CACHE ... FORCE` survives removal of the module that set it — `cmake -U
  CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER .` clears it. A stale launcher silently served
  objects in 0.2 s and invalidated a whole measurement round.
- **Warm up before measuring.** The first compile in a session is inflated by
  cold page cache for the module BMIs — this produced a fake 47% win once.
- **Whole-build breakdown**: parse `.ninja_log`, deduplicating on
  `(start, end, cmdhash)`.
- **Inside one TU**: `-ftime-trace`, then aggregate `InstantiateFunction` /
  `InstantiateClass` / `Source` events by `args.detail`.
