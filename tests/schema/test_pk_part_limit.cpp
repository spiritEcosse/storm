// Tests for ModelPrimaryKeyPartLimit<T> (#537): a composite primary key with more
// parts than the m2m/reverse-FK stitch key can hold is a compile-time error.
//
// The bug being closed: utilities::StitchKey — the map key the two-query eager load
// stitches Q2 rows onto their Q1 owner with — is a FIXED 32-byte inline buffer, and
// every part writes exactly one 8-byte word. Four parts fill it exactly; a fifth
// writes past the end. The only guard was assert(len_ + sizeof(word) <= CAPACITY)
// in StitchKey::append_word, which NDEBUG compiles out — so it was absent from
// exactly the Release configuration where the overrun would matter. A 5-part
// composite PK was a silent buffer overrun in a release build.
//
// DECIDED per #537 option 1: reject the model, rather than grow CAPACITY. The size
// is load-bearing — #504 measured a wider key costing ~4% on the stitch hot path,
// which is why single-PK models bypass StitchKey for a bare std::uint64_t — and
// folding surplus parts was rejected in #504 because two distinct keys colliding in
// the fold MIS-STITCHES rows onto the wrong owner (a correctness regression, not a
// recoverable map collision).
