# Run coverage tests in batches, one process per gtest suite, each producing
# a .profraw file that llvm-profdata merges later.
#
# Concurrency: batches run in parallel by default (one per suite, each emits an
# independent ${BUILD_DIR}/batch_${name}.profraw). Set COVERAGE_JOBS=N to cap
# concurrency (default: nproc --ignore=2). COVERAGE_JOBS=1 forces strictly serial
# — useful on shared hardware or when debugging a flaky suite. See issue #268.
#
# Historical note: this script was originally a workaround for what looked like
# a clang coverage-instrumentation segfault / hang. Issue #269 traced the hang
# to a Storm bug — a use-after-free of a thread-local `Statement*` cache in
# `AggregateStatement::execute_simple` — which manifested as an infinite loop
# under coverage instrumentation. The fix landed; this batched layout is kept
# because per-suite isolation is still the right shape (and #176 / #268 still
# matter for cross-module template coverage).
#
# IMPORTANT: Suites must NOT be split into individual test runs.
# Per-test profraw files lose cross-module template coverage data because
# the profiling counters for template instantiations across module boundaries
# require enough test volume within a single process to be properly recorded.

# The coverage gate requires a REAL PostgreSQL. Three constexpr transaction
# methods on the PG Connection (postgresql_connection.cppm in_transaction /
# enter_transaction / leave_transaction) plus part of pool.cppm are instantiated
# only by a live connection — tests/mock_libpq never reaches them — so without a
# server the run lands at ~99.8-99.9% and the 100% gate fails.
#
# Default to the local unix socket, but let an already-exported value win: that
# is how the CI coverage job points these tests at its postgres service
# container. This default previously lived in cmake/coverage-targets.cmake as an
# unconditional override, which meant the gate passed only on a machine that
# happened to run PG at this socket and failed for everyone else (#528).
#
# `${VAR+set}` tests DECLARATION, not emptiness: an explicitly-set value is
# passed through untouched (including an empty one), and only a genuinely unset
# variable gets the default.
#
# Note an empty value is NOT a way to disable PostgreSQL. libpq reads "" as "use
# the PG* environment defaults", so PQconnectdb("") succeeds on a machine with
# PGHOST/PGUSER exported (verified). backend_available() only rejects a NULL
# pointer, so an empty string reaches libpq. To genuinely force SQLite-only,
# clear the libpq defaults too:
#   env -u STORM_PG_CONNSTR -u PGHOST -u PGUSER -u PGDATABASE ...
# — which fails the 100% gate by design, since the PG-only lines go uncovered.
