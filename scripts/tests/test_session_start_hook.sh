# Tests for .claude/hooks/session-start-docker.sh (issues #651, #628).
#
# The hook has two jobs and the ORDER between them is the thing under test.
# `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` — the only thing that makes
# .githooks/pre-commit (and therefore commit.sh: format, clang-tidy, tests,
# the 100% coverage gate) run at all — must happen UNCONDITIONALLY, before
# every early exit the Docker provisioning half takes. #651: the wiring used to
# live only in CMakeLists.txt, i.e. behind a successful cmake configure, which
# is precisely what a session with no ../clang-p2996 cannot do; such a session
# committed with no checks and no warning. Moving an early exit above the
# wiring reintroduces exactly that, so each exit path gets its own scenario.
#
# Strategy: build a throwaway project dir (a real `git init` repo plus a stub
# scripts/dev-container.sh, so no container is ever provisioned), run the real
# hook against it with a controlled environment, and assert on core.hooksPath,
# on stdout (Claude Code's protocol channel — must stay clean), and on whether
# the stub was called. Each scenario is a function named scenario_<tag>; the
# dispatcher below owns the temp-dir boilerplate.
