# Tests for cmake/libcxx.cmake symlink behavior (issue #326, phase 1).
#
# Strategy: build a fake LIBCXX_ROOT layout in a temp dir, invoke
# cmake/libcxx.cmake from a minimal harness CMakeLists, and assert the
# symlink (or its absence) per scenario.
#
# Each scenario is a function named scenario_<tag>. The dispatcher loop
# below handles all per-test boilerplate (tmpdir, fake root, cmake invoke,
# cleanup) so scenarios only encode their setup tweaks and assertions.
#
# Prerequisite: a cmake at or above HARNESS_CMAKE_MIN below. It is checked and
# reported up front (issue #645) rather than assumed: the generated harness
# declares the project's own cmake_minimum_required, so an older cmake aborts
# every configure on that line — before cmake/libcxx.cmake is ever included —
# and five of the six scenarios fail for a reason none of them is about.
