# Tests for cmake/libcxx.cmake symlink behavior (issue #326, phase 1).
#
# Strategy: build a fake LIBCXX_ROOT layout in a temp dir, invoke
# cmake/libcxx.cmake from a minimal harness CMakeLists, and assert the
# symlink (or its absence) per scenario.
#
# Each scenario is a function named scenario_<tag>. The dispatcher loop
# below handles all per-test boilerplate (tmpdir, fake root, cmake invoke,
# cleanup) so scenarios only encode their setup tweaks and assertions.
#
# Prerequisites: cmake at or above the project's own cmake_minimum_required
# (read from CMakeLists.txt below), and ninja. Both are checked and reported
# up front (issue #645) rather than assumed: the generated harness declares
# that same floor and configures with -G Ninja, so either one missing aborts
# every configure before cmake/libcxx.cmake is ever included, and the
# scenarios then fail for a reason none of them is about.
