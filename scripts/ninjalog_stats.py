"""Whole-build compile-time breakdown from a ninja build log.

Implements the "Whole-build breakdown" bullet of
docs/internals/performance/COMPILE_TIME.md#method, so the tables in that
document can be regenerated rather than retyped. Both rules it states are
load-bearing:

  * **Deduplicate on (start, end, cmdhash).** One C++ module compile emits both
    a .pcm/.bmi and a .o, and ninja logs a line per OUTPUT — counting the log
    verbatim double-counts every module edge. Deduplicating on the invocation's
    identity collapses them to one.

  * **Object compiles only.** The module-scan edges (.ddi/.dd/.modmap, plus the
    corpus .json) are real build work but are not compiles, and the baseline
    table excludes them. They are reported separately rather than silently
    dropped, so the exclusion stays visible.

Note the log records wall time per edge, so the "sec" column sums to more than
the build's wall clock whenever ninja ran jobs in parallel — that ratio is the
effective parallelism, printed at the end.

Usage:
    scripts/ninjalog_stats.py build/debug/.ninja_log

For a total comparable with the document's, measure a build from scratch
(`rm -rf build/debug` first): the log accumulates across runs, so a tree built
incrementally reports only the edges those runs happened to rebuild.
