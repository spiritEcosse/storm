# Shared clang-tidy skip-list classification, sourced (not executed) by
# scripts/run_clang_tidy.sh's three modes (--diff/--full/--all).
#
# Extracted from run_clang_tidy.sh in #550 so the classification can be
# unit-tested in isolation (scripts/tests/test_run_clang_tidy_skiplist.sh)
# without needing a live clang-tidy binary or compile_commands.json. Both
# is_known_unparseable() and is_always_skip_file() are the single source of
# truth consulted by every mode — --diff drops matching files' diff hunks
# before clang-tidy-diff.py ever sees them (filter_skiplist_from_diff below),
# --full/--all skip them post-hoc in run_tidy()'s has_compile_error branch.
# Keeping them in one sourced file is what makes "stays consistent" (#550
# DoD) mechanical rather than a convention two call sites have to remember.

# Known-skip list: files clang-tidy cannot parse and we accept that.
#
# Returns 0 (true) if a file is expected to fail clang-tidy parsing.
#
# These are precise file paths, not directory wildcards. The former broad
# "tests/*|benchmarks/*" wildcard was replaced in Issue #308 because 39 test
# files and most bench files parse fine — the wildcard was silently masking
# parse failures in files that should be clean.
#
# Files genuinely unparseable:
#   shared/query_builder.hpp — pseudo-module header; must be included after
#       `import storm;` so clang-tidy sees it without the BMI and fails.
#
#   Test headers that must come after `import storm;` — clang-tidy parses
#   them standalone and hits missing storm symbols:
#   tests/test_models.h, tests/test_seed_helpers.h, tests/test_select_runner.h,
#   tests/test_write_runner.h, tests/test_yaml_register.h,
#   tests/query/test_aggregate_fixture.h, tests/query/test_m2m_models.h,
#   tests/query/test_fields_models.h, tests/crud/test_composite_pk_models.h,
#   tests/test_parser.hpp, tests/test_unified_yaml_body.h,
#   tests/tools/storm_schema/models.h, shared/models.h
#
#   tests/test_unified_yaml_body.h joined with the YAML-harness split (#561).
#   It needs `import storm;` like its siblings, and additionally reads
#   STORM_UNIFIED_CASES_FILE, which the INCLUDING TU defines — parsed standalone
#   that macro is undeclared and the static_assert guarding it errors out. The
#   code is still linted through the four tests/yaml/test_unified_yaml_*.cpp TUs
#   that include it, each of which has a real compile-commands entry.
#
#   The 12 *_body.h files are the compile-time TU-split bodies (each holds the
#   shared TYPED_TEST_SUITE/TYPED_TEST content for one _sqlite.cpp/_pg.cpp pair):
#   tests/crud/test_composite_fk_join_body.h, tests/crud/test_composite_pk_crud_body.h,
#   tests/crud/test_crud_body.h, tests/query/test_aggregate_having_body.h,
#   tests/query/test_aggregate_optional_body.h, tests/query/test_composite_m2m_junction_body.h,
#   tests/query/test_composite_m2m_through_body.h,
#   tests/query/test_fk_column_name_orderby_aggregate_body.h,
#   tests/query/test_many_to_many_body.h, tests/query/test_many_to_many_multi_body.h,
#   tests/query/test_reverse_fk_body.h, tests/schema/test_fk_fields_body.h.
#   Same shape as tests/test_unified_yaml_body.h above: each guards on two macros
#   (STORM_SPLIT_TYPES / STORM_SPLIT_TYPE_NAMES) that the including .cpp defines
#   before the #include, so parsed standalone the #error guard fires. Linted
#   through the 24 tests/**/*_sqlite.cpp / *_pg.cpp TUs that include them, each
#   with a real compile-commands entry.
#
#   tests/tools/storm_schema/models.h and shared/models.h joined the list with
#   the fields:: proxies (#518). Both call storm::field_specs_for inside a
#   `consteval` block, which is a harder
#   dependency on `import storm;` than the [[= storm::*]] annotations alone —
#   shared/models.h parsed standalone before that and does not now. Their
#   #include <meta> also drags libc++'s own <meta> into a non-C++26 parse, which
#   reports `unknown type name 'concept'` against the TOOLCHAIN header; skipping
#   at the source stops that too, without a post-hoc output filter that would
#   also mask a genuinely malformed concept in Storm's own code.
#
#   benchmarks/bench_register.h — includes benchmark/benchmark.h which
#   clang-tidy cannot parse (gbench macro / linkage issue).
#
#   Benchmark textual headers — #included inside anonymous namespaces of main
#   TUs; cannot be parsed standalone (need import storm or benchmark BMI):
#   benchmarks/models.hpp, benchmarks/m2m_models.hpp, benchmarks/benchmark_tests.hpp,
#   benchmarks/dashboard/args.hpp, benchmarks/dashboard/backup.hpp,
#   benchmarks/dashboard/db.hpp, benchmarks/dashboard/events.hpp,
#   benchmarks/dashboard/tui_render.hpp, benchmarks/dashboard/models.hpp
#
#   benchmarks/schema.cppm — parses fine, but ANY ASTMatcher-based check
#       (every enabled check) SIGSEGVs clang-tidy inside
#       RecursiveASTVisitor::TraverseTemplateInstantiations on the std-module
#       VarTemplateDecl `std::__desugars_to_v` (a clang-p2996 ParentMap/AST
#       traversal bug over `import std;` instantiations). Reproduces with the
#       pre-#364 7-category config and with a single readability check, so it is
#       a toolchain crash, not a Storm-code or check-config issue. Tracked with
#       the other clang-p2996 module crashes under issue #262.
#
#   python/bindings.cpp — `import storm;`, same standalone-parse issue as the
#       test/benchmark headers above.
#
#   fuzz/*.cpp and fuzz/fuzz_models.h (#550) — same shape as the test/benchmark
#   headers above: `import storm;` + `#include <meta>`, so a standalone parse
#   fails with `module 'storm' not found` / `use of undeclared identifier
#   'storm'`. Genuinely absent from compile_commands.json too — ENABLE_FUZZING
#   is off by default even under ninja-release (see cmake/fuzz.cmake), so
#   there is no compile-database entry to fall back on even when it is on.
#   Found in review (#550): before the post-hoc output-regex filter was
#   retired, its generic `module`/`import`/`use of undeclared` alternatives
#   accidentally covered these files too, so this gap was silent — a staged
#   fuzz/ edit never actually blocked a commit, but for the wrong reason (a
#   message match, not a reviewed skip-list entry). Listing them explicitly
#   is what #550 changed the mechanism to require.
