# SessionStart hook. Two independent jobs, and the ORDER between them matters:
#
# 1. Wire git's pre-commit hook (issue #651) — UNCONDITIONAL, before the
#    provisioning half can decide it has nothing to do. `core.hooksPath` is
#    local config that a clone never carries, and the only other place that
#    sets it is CMakeLists.txt, as a side effect of a successful cmake
#    configure — exactly what a session with no ../clang-p2996 cannot do. Such
#    a session therefore committed with commit.sh (format, clang-tidy, tests,
#    the 100% coverage gate, and the two self-tests it runs even for an
#    otherwise no-op commit — #543, #550) never firing, and with nothing in the
#    output to say so. Doing this after any of the three provisioning bail-outs
#    reintroduces that silent gap, which is why each bail-out has its own
#    scenario in scripts/tests/test_session_start_hook.sh.
#
# 2. Provision scripts/dev-container.sh's Docker build environment (issue
#    #628): Claude Code's remote/sandboxed sessions start with no local
#    ../clang-p2996 toolchain, so no CMake preset can configure, build, run
#    tests, or run clang-format/clang-tidy without it. Provisioned in the
#    background, so it's ready by the time a session wants to build.
#
#    No-op when:
#      - not a remote session (only remote sessions lack the toolchain locally)
#      - ../clang-p2996 is already present (nothing to provision)
#      - docker isn't installed (nothing this hook can do)
#
# See scripts/dev-container.sh for the up/exec/status/down commands this
# provisions, and CLAUDE.md's Prerequisites section for how a session is
# expected to use it once ready.

# that is the channel that becomes session context — i.e. the one place a
# warning actually reaches whoever can act on it. A missing gate must never be
# as quiet as a passing one (#651), but it must not fail session start either:
# nothing below depends on the wiring.
