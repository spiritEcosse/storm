# ─── clang-tidy release prerequisites (issue #557) ──────────────────────────
# clang-tidy replays build/release/compile_commands.json and only PARSES — it
# never links — so building the full default release target set to enable it
# spends ~90% of its time on the ~110 release test TUs of storm_tests that
# clang-tidy never opens. Measured on a cold tree (4 cores): 764s for the full
# set against 172s for the three things it actually needs:
#
#   a) the storm library BMIs, for `import storm;`
#   b) the BMIs of the module targets CMake SYNTHESIZES for module consumers
#      (CMakeFiles/*@synth_N.dir/*.bmi). These are discovered through dyndep,
#      so they are not reachable as static ninja targets until the .dd files
#      exist — building `storm` alone leaves them absent and clang-tidy then
#      fails with `module 'std' not found`, which is #489's first failure mode.
#   c) the mock test binaries, for #489's second failure mode.
#
# FAIL SAFE, per #557: every uncertain path falls back to the full build. A
# wrong skip is expensive to attribute — a missing BMI does not make clang-tidy
# error out, it degrades it to a PARTIAL PARSE that emits false warnings (4
# instead of 1 on src/orm/utilities.cppm, verified), and the hook runs
# clang-tidy with --fix.
# Answers "does clang-tidy have everything it needs to parse the staged files?"
# Prints exactly `complete` when it does. EVERY other outcome — `incomplete`, a
# crash, a missing python3, a staged file with no compile_commands entry — is
# read as incomplete by the caller, so an unanticipated failure rebuilds rather
# than silently skips. That direction is the whole point (#557 DoD): a missing
# BMI does not make clang-tidy fail, it degrades it to a partial parse that
# emits FALSE warnings, and the hook runs clang-tidy with --fix.
