/**
 * @file color.h
 * @brief Color enum — the enum-column type used by ExtendedTypes.
 *
 * The one header here with no storm dependency, so unlike its siblings it parses
 * standalone — which is why it keeps an include guard and stays off
 * scripts/lib/clang_tidy_skiplist.sh. Still included after `import storm;` in
 * practice, since its consumers pull extended_types.h alongside it.

// Enum type for testing enum field support.
//
// The `: int` is load-bearing, not an oversight: schema.cppm's integer_width_of<T>
// resolves an enum column's PG width from its underlying type (#603), so this is
// what makes the column INTEGER. Narrowing it to std::uint8_t as
// performance-enum-size suggests would silently emit SMALLINT instead and change
// the DDL that tests/schema/test_types.cpp asserts.
// NOLINTNEXTLINE(performance-enum-size)
