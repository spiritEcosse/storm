# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with this repository.

**📚 Full Documentation**: [docs/README.md](docs/README.md)

## Project Overview

Storm is a C++26 ORM library for SQLite using compile-time reflection to automatically map C++ structs to database tables without macros.

**Performance**: 96-108% efficiency vs raw SQLite (Release builds). See [benchmarks/README.md](benchmarks/README.md).

**Key Features**: Compile-time SQL generation, single-level (Connection-level) statement caching, thread-local caching, type-erased JOINs, pure C++26 reflection for WHERE clauses.

## Behavioral Guidelines

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**C++ coding standards**: When writing, reviewing, or refactoring C++ code, follow the rules in [`.claude/agents/rule-standards.md`](.claude/agents/rule-standards.md) (C++ Core Guidelines — RAII, immutability, type safety, concepts, Rule of Zero/Five, etc.).

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

### 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.

## Critical Safety Rules

**⚠️ NEVER violate these rules:**

1. **NEVER delete `.git`** - Do not run `rm -rf .git`
2. **NEVER push without approval** - Ask before `git push` (exception: user says "commit and push")
3. **NEVER skip the pre-commit hook** - Do not use `--no-verify`; `commit.sh` enforces format, tidy, test, coverage, sonar automatically
4. **NEVER work directly on `develop` for issue-linked tasks** - Always create `feature/<N>-<description>` branch first (see [Branching Rules](#branching-rules))
5. **ALWAYS show files before commit** - Run `git status --short`, get user approval, then commit
6. **ALWAYS benchmark after code changes** - Use Release builds; revert if ANY slowdown
7. **NEVER run sanitizer builds locally — CI runs them** - `ninja-asan-ubsan` (memory + UB) and `ninja-tsan` (data races) run in CI on every PR that touches `src/`, `tests/`, or cmake files (skipped otherwise — see `scripts/detect-changes.sh` / the `changes` job in `ci.yml`); check results with `gh pr checks <PR#>`. Fix or revert if CI reports new violations. Do NOT build or run sanitizer presets locally.
8. **ALWAYS update docs AND agent files after changes** - Code + docs + `.claude/agents/*.md` commit together. If you change a feature, preset, command, or pattern described in any agent file, update that agent file too.
   - **Agent `description:` MUST stay on ONE physical line** — write newlines as literal `\n` escapes (see `reviewer.md`). A description spanning real lines breaks the YAML frontmatter parse and Claude Code drops the agent **silently**: it never appears in the available-agents list and cannot be dispatched, with no warning. This shipped twice (#543 — `storm-sql-reviewer`, `storm-buildsystem-reviewer`, both undispatchable from merge). Enforced by `scripts/check-agent-frontmatter.sh`, run by `commit.sh` on any staged agent file and by the `agent-frontmatter` CI job.
9. **ALWAYS write thorough unit tests BEFORE implementing** - Every feature or fix needs comprehensive tests first (see [Testing Checklist](#thorough-testing-checklist)). Workflow: (1) write tests → (2) run — new tests MUST fail (proves they test real behavior) → (3) implement → (4) run again — ALL tests must pass
10. **SonarCloud gate MUST pass before merging** - Zero issues on new code; no exceptions, even for minor issues (see [SonarCloud Gate](#sonarcloud-gate-mandatory-before-merge))
11. **NEVER use `throw` for compile-time errors in `consteval` functions** - Use `requires` constraints instead. Define a concept that checks the condition and constrain the template. The `throw "string literal"` trick works but fires late with a poor error message. `requires` fires at the call site with a clear constraint violation. Use `std::unreachable()` after the loop body if needed to satisfy the return type.
12. **NEVER close an issue without verifying all subtasks** - Before closing, read the issue body and confirm every "Definition of done" checkbox was genuinely completed. Only check off items that were delivered. If some are intentionally skipped, ask the user first.
13. **ALWAYS run the relevant reviewer agent(s) before every commit that touches code** - After staging (`git add`) and BEFORE `git commit`, dispatch the reviewer(s) matching the staged diff and address their findings. The pre-commit hook checks mechanics (format, tidy, tests, coverage); the reviewer agents check design and correctness. Applies to ALL code commits, including inline fixes and SonarCloud-fix commits; docs-only commits are exempt.
    - `storm-code-reviewer` - any `src/`, `tests/`, or other C++ change. Dispatch on every code commit. Reviews the **C++** — RAII, concepts, module structure, hot-path patterns.
    - `storm-sql-reviewer` - any `src/orm/statements/**`, `src/orm/schema.cppm`, or `src/db/*_statement.cppm` change. Dispatch alongside `storm-code-reviewer`. Reviews the **generated SQL text and bind sequence** (text↔bind agreement, column-name derivation, set semantics, sizer↔writer agreement, dialect matrix) — a blind spot `storm-code-reviewer` structurally cannot see since that code compiles cleanly and looks idiomatic even when the SQL it emits is wrong (#501, #506, #500).
    - `storm-buildsystem-reviewer` - any `cmake/**`, `CMakePresets.json`, `.github/workflows/**`, `commit.sh`, `.githooks/**`, or `scripts/**` change. Reviews CMake + presets + CI + hooks as one coupled system (cross-file consistency, cold-path correctness) — runs **alongside**, not instead of, `storm-code-reviewer` when a commit touches both.

**Doc conventions:**
- ASK before creating new `.md` files
- UPPERCASE doc filenames — `GETTING_STARTED.md`, not `getting-started.md`

### GitHub Issue Workflow
- **Before starting**: Read the issue body with `gh issue view <N>`. Check for a **"Definition of done"** section or checkbox subtasks (e.g., `- [ ] Each error path has a test`).
- **Verify context**: Before planning or making changes, cross-check the issue description (file paths, line numbers, API references, assumptions) against the actual codebase. If anything is outdated or wrong, **report discrepancies to the user** before proceeding.
- **Track subtasks**: Use those checkboxes as your acceptance criteria. **Before committing**, check off all verified subtasks: `gh issue edit <N> --body "..."` with `- [x]` replacing `- [ ]`. Do not defer this to after the commit or merge.
- **Close when done**: After all subtasks are checked off, close the issue with `gh issue close <N>`.
- **Superpowers skills (`brainstorming`, `writing-plans`, `executing-plans`)**: for issue-linked work, use the GitHub issue body as the spec/plan/results record instead of writing new files under `docs/superpowers/specs/`, `docs/superpowers/plans/`, or `docs/superpowers/results/` — the issue description and its checkboxes already serve that role (see rule #12 and "Track subtasks" above). Only fall back to `docs/superpowers/` for ad-hoc work with no linked issue. Note: `docs/superpowers/` is gitignored (not committed) — it's a local scratch area only.

### Branching Rules
- **ALWAYS start a feature branch in a git worktree, NOT in the default project folder** — create the branch in its own `git worktree` under `../worktrees/<branch-name>/` (relative to the main repo dir `storm_develop`, i.e. a sibling of the repo, NOT inside it) so the main working directory stays clean and on `develop`. Do all work for the branch inside that worktree. Run `git worktree remove` after the branch is merged.
- **GitHub Issue work**: Create and link a feature branch using `gh issue develop <N> --name feature/<N>-<short-description> --base develop --checkout` — this creates the branch, links it to the issue in GitHub. Then add it as a worktree (`git worktree add ../worktrees/<branch-name> feature/<N>-<short-description>`) and work from there instead of checking it out in place.
- **Create pull request**: After pushing a feature branch, ALWAYS create a PR with `gh pr create --base develop` including `Closes #<N>` in the body to auto-link and auto-close the issue on merge.
- **After creating a PR**: Wait 30 seconds, then run `/sonarcloud-status`. If there are **zero issues** on new code, check CI jobs with `gh pr checks <PR#> --watch`. Only merge after **both** SonarCloud gate AND all CI jobs (ninja-debug, ninja-release, ninja-asan-ubsan, ninja-tsan) pass (`gh pr merge --squash`). If ANY SonarCloud issues or CI failures, fix them all, push, and re-check until clean.
- **Close issue after merge**: After merging a feature branch into `develop`, ALWAYS close the issue with `gh issue close <N>`. Do NOT wait to be asked.
- **Switch to develop after merge**: After merging and closing the issue, ALWAYS run `git checkout develop && git pull` to return to the main branch.
- **Ad-hoc fixes** (no GitHub Issue): Work directly on `develop`.

### SonarCloud Gate (MANDATORY before merge)

The `/sonarcloud-status` skill (uses `sonar` CLI) is **branch-aware**:

| Context | Mode | What it checks |
|---|---|---|
| `develop` / `master` / `main` | **Branch mode** | Full project — ALL existing issues on the branch |
| Feature branch or explicit PR number | **PR mode** | New code only — waits for Sonar to finish, then checks changed lines |

**Quality gate: "Storm Strict"** (custom gate assigned to this project):
- `new_violations > 0` → FAIL (zero new issues of ANY severity: bugs, smells, vulnerabilities, even minor)
- `new_duplicated_lines_density > 0` → FAIL (zero code duplication on new lines)
- `new_security_hotspots_reviewed < 100%` → FAIL

**GitHub branch protection**: `develop` requires `SonarCloud Code Analysis` to pass before any merge — enforced at the repository level, cannot be bypassed.

**Before merging a PR (run from the feature branch):**
1. Run `/sonarcloud-status` — it auto-detects the PR and **waits** for SonarCloud analysis to finish.
2. **If gate passes** (zero violations, zero duplications): merge the PR into `develop`.
3. **If gate fails** (ANY issue or ANY duplication — no matter how minor): fix ALL reported issues on the feature branch, push, then re-check until the gate passes.
4. **Only merge after a clean SonarCloud gate** — GitHub will block the merge otherwise.

**Checking overall project health (on `develop`):**
Run `/sonarcloud-status` while on `develop` to see the full project picture — all existing issues, overall metrics, and quality gate status for the branch.

### SonarCloud Coding Rules (follow proactively when writing code)

These rules are enforced by SonarCloud analysis. Follow them when writing new code to avoid issues:

| Rule | What to do | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **S125** | Never leave commented-out code. Remove migration comments, old code, data comments like `// (Alice,30), (Bob,25)` | SonarCloud flags any comment that looks like code |
| **S3656** | Use `public:` (not `protected:`) for GTest fixture member variables | SonarCloud forbids protected members in classes |
| **S6185** | Use `std::format("Person{}", i)` instead of `"Person" + std::to_string(i)` | Prefer std::format over string concatenation |
| **S3659** | Use `\|\|` and `&&` instead of `or` and `and` | Alternative operators forbidden |
| **S6164** | Use `std::numbers::pi` instead of `3.14159` | Use standard math constants |
| **S6197** | Use `std::ranges::sort(vec)` instead of `std::ranges::sort(vec.begin(), vec.end())` | Prefer range overloads |
| **S6177** | Use `using enum EnumType;` to avoid verbose `EnumType::Value` repetition | Reduce enum verbosity |
| **S7034** | Use `str.contains(substr)` instead of `str.find(substr) != npos` | Prefer C++23 contains() |
| **S6009** | Use `std::string_view` for read-only string parameters | Avoid const std::string& for read-only |
| **S6003** | Use `emplace_back` instead of `push_back` when constructing in-place | Avoid unnecessary copies |
| **S1659** | Avoid `auto x = Type{};` — use `Type x;` directly | SonarCloud may flag brace-init as multi-identifier |
| **S912** | No side effects in `&&`/`\|\|` right operands (e.g., `--depth` in `&& --depth == 0`) | Separate side effects from conditions |
| **S6045** | Use `std::set<T, std::less<>>` for string containers | Transparent comparator for heterogeneous lookup |

**When NOSONAR is acceptable** (add `// NOSONAR` on the exact flagged line):
- `S5025`: GTest `RegisterTest` requires raw `new` — can't use smart pointers
- `S6188`: consteval functions use `ptr+sz` pattern — `std::span` not reliable in consteval
- `S3776`: consteval JSON parsers and `if constexpr` dispatch have inherent complexity
- `S1820`: Flat structs for consteval parsing intentionally exceed 20 fields
- `S6024`: GTest fixture static helpers are idiomatic — no need to extract as free functions
- `S954`: `#include "test_models.h"` MUST come after `import storm;` — can't move to top

### Commit & Push Workflow

**The standard case — committing everything (`git add -A`):**
```bash
git status --short           # Show files
# Get user approval
git add -A && git commit -m "message"
# Pre-commit hook (commit.sh): clang-format (C++) + cmake-format → clang-tidy → tests → coverage
# Smart skips: no C++/cmake → skip all; cmake-only → tests+coverage+cmake-format; C++ only-bench → skip tests/coverage
# Self-heal (#489): commit.sh configures + fully builds build/release before clang-tidy
#   (BMIs + mock binaries, so no missing compile_commands.json / std.pcm) and
#   build/debug before running the test binaries directly (so none of the three
#   — storm_tests, storm_mock_tests, storm_pq_mock_tests — is missing). No-op on
#   the warm path; covers both the git-hook path and a manual ./commit.sh on a
#   fresh worktree.
# The hook reformats + re-stages (git add -u) BEFORE the commit object is
# created, so this single command already captures the final, formatted
# state — no separate format-then-commit dance needed (#605).

git push
# Pre-push hook (.githooks/pre-push): SonarCloud gate disabled (C++26 not yet supported)
# See: https://github.com/spiritEcosse/storm/issues/113
```

**If the hook fails on a later step (tidy/tests/coverage):** the tree is
already reformatted and staged by that point (format runs first, step 1-2).
Just fix the reported failure and re-run `git commit -m "message"` — no need
to `git add -A` again unless you touched more files.

**Scoped/partial commit (staging specific files, not `-A`):** the hook's
`format`/`cmake-format` targets scan the **whole tree**, not just staged
files (`cmake/format.cmake` has no staged-file filter), and its `git add -u`
re-stage applies to every tracked file, not just the ones you staged. That
can pull unrelated formatting fixes into your commit. To keep a scoped
commit clean, format first and review before staging:
```bash
cmake --build --preset ninja-debug --target format          # clang-format (C++)
cmake --build --preset ninja-debug --target cmake-format    # cmake-format (CMake)
git status --short            # confirm only your intended files changed
git add <files> && git commit -m "message"
```

### Benchmarking (Release only!)
```bash
cmake --preset ninja-release && cmake --build --preset ninja-release
./build/release/benchmarks/storm_bench                                          # Full Google Benchmark run
./build/release/benchmarks/storm_bench --benchmark_filter='Storm/SELECT/.*'     # Category filter
./build/release/benchmarks/storm_bench --benchmark_repetitions=10               # Stats: median/mean/stddev
./build/release/benchmarks/storm_anchors                                        # Raw SQLite anchors (release-time spot check)
```

### Code Coverage
```bash
# ninja-debug has coverage enabled by default
cmake --preset ninja-debug && cmake --build --preset ninja-debug

# Console summary (quick) — ninja-debug-coverage unsets STORM_PG_CONNSTR (SQLite + mock PG only)
cmake --build --preset ninja-debug-coverage --target coverage

# HTML report (detailed)
cmake --build --preset ninja-debug-coverage --target coverage-html
# Open build/debug/coverage/html-filtered/index.html
```

**Enforced in CI, not just locally (#528)**: the `coverage` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
runs `ninja-debug-coverage` on every PR that touches `src/`, `tests/`, or cmake files (skipped
otherwise, same `changes`-job gate as the sanitizer builds above) and fails below **100% line
coverage** — the same gate
`commit.sh` step 5 applies, so the threshold is independently reproduced rather than self-reported
from one machine. It parses the **line** row specifically (functions ~81%, branches ~92% are not
gated) and uploads the HTML report as a `coverage-html` artifact on pass and failure alike.
The 100% is of the **filtered** set — 24 files / 8613 lines, `LCOV_EXCL` markers excluded from the
denominator — not of every line in the tree.

**⚠️ Coverage requires a running PostgreSQL** — the PG `Connection`'s `constexpr` transaction-nesting
methods and part of `pool.cppm` are instantiated only by a live connection (the libpq mock does not
reach them). Without a server the tree measures **~99.8-99.9%** and the gate fails; function coverage
dropping from 80.6% to **48.7%** is the tell, and the run prints a `WARN: PostgreSQL unreachable`
line. `scripts/coverage-run-batched.sh` defaults `STORM_PG_CONNSTR` to `host=/var/run/postgresql`;
an exported value wins, which is how CI targets its `postgres` service container. Note the
`ninja-debug-coverage` **build preset** nulls the variable, so the documented local command always
uses the script's default — invoke the script directly to point elsewhere. If coverage fails just
under 100%, check PG is up before suspecting your code.

See [docs/internals/testing/CODE_COVERAGE.md](docs/internals/testing/CODE_COVERAGE.md) for details.

### Prerequisites
- Custom Clang with C++26 reflection (`../clang-p2996/`)
- SQLite3, CMake 3.30+, Ninja

**No `../clang-p2996` locally? (issue #628)** — Claude Code remote/sandboxed sessions start
with no compiler and can't configure, build, run tests, or run clang-format/clang-tidy without
one. `scripts/dev-container.sh` wraps `docker/ci/Dockerfile` into a long-lived build container
plus a PostgreSQL sidecar (connected over a shared unix-socket volume, matching
`CMakePresets.json`'s own `STORM_PG_CONNSTR` exactly — no override needed), so build commands
run via `exec` instead of natively. In a sandbox whose outbound HTTPS is TLS-intercepted, the
same Dockerfile is built with an extra `cacerts` build context that trusts the proxy's CA before
`pacman -Syu`; real CI builds the same file with no such context, so nothing changes for it:
```bash
scripts/dev-container.sh up                    # builds/starts the containers (idempotent)
scripts/dev-container.sh exec cmake --preset ninja-debug
scripts/dev-container.sh exec cmake --build --preset ninja-debug
scripts/dev-container.sh exec ./build/debug/tests/storm_tests
scripts/dev-container.sh exec ./commit.sh       # or `exec git commit -m ...` — see below
scripts/dev-container.sh status                 # show container state
scripts/dev-container.sh rebuild                # drop image + containers, rebuild from scratch
scripts/dev-container.sh down                   # stop and remove the containers
```
`exec` falls through to running the command natively when `../clang-p2996` is already present,
so build commands can be prefixed with it unconditionally in either kind of session. `up` (and
therefore `exec`, which calls it) serializes on a flock, so calling it before every command — or
concurrently from more than one shell — is safe. The repo is bind-mounted at the same absolute
path inside the container as on the host, so `CMakeCache.txt` and git's `core.hooksPath` never
disagree between a host shell and an `exec` one — which means `git commit`/`./commit.sh` work
correctly via `exec`, but a container-only session (no native toolchain) must run them that way:
a plain host-side `git commit` still fires the pre-commit hook, which needs the compiler rule 3
says not to skip.

A `SessionStart` hook (`.claude/hooks/session-start-docker.sh`) provisions this automatically in
the background on a remote session with no native toolchain — **wire it up once** by adding it
to `.claude/settings.json`'s `hooks.SessionStart` (a security-sensitive file Claude Code will
not modify autonomously):
```json
"SessionStart": [
  { "hooks": [ { "type": "command", "command": "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/session-start-docker.sh" } ] }
]
```

See [docs/internals/architecture/](docs/internals/architecture/) for design decisions.

### Key Design Decisions
1. C++26 reflection for automatic field mapping
2. Concept-based DB abstraction (PostgreSQL/MySQL ready)
3. Compile-time SQL generation (zero runtime overhead)
4. Single Connection-level statement cache + thread-local SQL caching (20x+ speedup). Statements are per-call temporaries owned by the result proxy; the L1/L2 caches were removed in #214 as they gave no measurable benefit.
5. Batch operations with smart thresholds (SQLite limit = 999)
6. Type-erased JOINs via abstract base class

## Performance Guidelines

**Target**: ≥95% of raw SQLite efficiency. Performance > code cleanliness.

### Hot Path Optimizations

| Optimization | Improvement | When to Use |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| Flat code over nested lambdas | ~3-4% | Hot paths, inner loops |
| Raw pointer caching in loops | ~5-6% | Query extraction loops |
| Template methods for modules | ~1-3% | Cross-module hot paths |

> Statement preparation is cached once, at the Connection level (`prepare_cached`,
> see [STATEMENT_CACHING.md](docs/internals/architecture/STATEMENT_CACHING.md)). The former
> per-QuerySet (L1) and per-Statement (L2) pointer caches were removed in #214
> after benchmarks showed no measurable benefit — do not reintroduce them.

```cpp
// Cache raw pointer in loops (5-6% faster)
sqlite3_stmt* raw = stmt->handle();
while (sqlite3_step(raw) == SQLITE_ROW) { ... }
```

### Fair Benchmark Rules
- Setup outside loop, execute inside
- Same algorithm, containers, decision logic for both Storm and raw
- **Same SCHEMA** — the raw anchor's `CREATE TABLE` must mirror what Storm's schema generator emits (e.g. `id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT`, NOT plain `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY`). AUTOINCREMENT alone adds ~358 ns/insert of `sqlite_sequence` bookkeeping inside `sqlite3_step`; a mismatch silently halved the INSERT `% of raw`.
- Use latency (ms/query) for different result sizes

See [docs/internals/performance/PERFORMANCE.md](docs/internals/performance/PERFORMANCE.md).

## Supported Field Types

`int`, `int64_t`, `double`, `float`, `bool`, `std::string`, `std::string_view`, `std::optional<T>`, `std::vector<uint8_t>` (BLOB)

**Annotation spelling (#442)**: annotation names are re-exported into the top-level `storm`
namespace — write `storm::primary`, `storm::fk<>`, `storm::many_to_many<>`,
`storm::reverse_fk<...>` instead of the longer `storm::meta::...`. The `storm::meta::` spelling
still works (re-exports are additive). Internal reflection helpers (`is_fk_field`,
`find_primary_key`, …) stay in `storm::meta`.

**Free-standing flag annotations (#492)**: the column flags are free-standing tag-object
annotations — `storm::primary`, `storm::primary_autoincrement`, `storm::indexed`,
`storm::unique`, `storm::auto_create`, `storm::auto_update`, `storm::signed_storage`,
`storm::full_unsigned` (plus `storm::primary_part`, #500) — replacing the former `enum class FieldAttr` (breaking, no
dual-spelling). Each is an empty tag struct + `inline constexpr` object in the
`storm_orm_field_attr` leaf (`storm::meta`), mirroring `fk<>`; detection scans
`annotations_of(m)` for the tag type (`has_annotation_type<Tag>`), the same pattern as
`is_fk_field`. The per-flag predicates (`is_unique`, `is_indexed`, `is_auto_create`,
`is_auto_update`, `has_full_unsigned_attr`, `has_signed_storage_attr`) keep their
names/signatures; PK detection routes through `is_primary_member(info)` (matches `primary`,
`primary_autoincrement`, OR `primary_part`). The exclusivity the enum gave for free is restored by the
`ModelAnnotationsValid<T>` concept (in `base.cppm`, ANDed into the `BaseStatement<T>`
constraint list), which rejects per member: `primary` + `primary_autoincrement`, or
`signed_storage` + `full_unsigned`. DDL is byte-identical — pure spelling change.

**Composite & non-integer primary keys (#500-#537, #507, #565)** — `[[= storm::primary_part]]` on
two or more members declares a multi-column PK; `storm::UUID` is also accepted as a key. Both are
**never DB-generated**, which is the rule most of the machinery turns on: the key columns are
caller data, so they are INSERTed like any other column and there is nothing to `RETURN`. A
composite key spans at most **4** parts (`StitchKey`'s buffer; a 5th is a compile-time error).
Single-PK integer models are byte-identical throughout — every widening is `if constexpr`-dispatched.

Two failure modes recur across this whole area and are worth knowing before touching it:
a **hardcode only a non-default model reaches** (a literal `"id"`, a literal `INTEGER`) sits dead
behind an `if constexpr` and ships green; and **SQLite vs PG disagree about what is an error** —
SQLite does not type-check FK targets or validate `REFERENCES` columns, PG rejects both, so wrong
DDL silently misbehaves on one and fails loudly on the other. Test these paths with `TYPED_TEST`
on BOTH backends, never SQL-text assertions alone.

Per-issue design notes (rationale + the failure each prevents):
[docs/internals/architecture/COMPOSITE_PRIMARY_KEYS.md](docs/internals/architecture/COMPOSITE_PRIMARY_KEYS.md).
User-facing usage: [docs/guide/reference/FIELD_TYPES.md](docs/guide/reference/FIELD_TYPES.md).

**Nothing is RETURNed for a caller-supplied key (#502/#572)**: `RETURNING <pk>` is emitted only
when the DATABASE generates the key — i.e. a single-column INTEGER PK. A composite key (#502) and
a `storm::UUID` key (#572) are both caller data, so plain `insert()` on either resolves to
`std::expected<void, Error>` and an explicit `insert<ReturnId::Yes>` is a compile error
(`ReturnIdSupported`). The `on_conflict()` terminals resolve the same way, but from the MODEL
SHAPE alone — `ReturnId` does not propagate through them, so `insert<ReturnId::No>(int_pk_obj)
.on_conflict<…>().update<…>()` still returns the id. One predicate,
`BaseStatement::pk_is_db_generated_()`, gates all four
decision points (the default, the gate, and UpsertGrammar's two RETURNING clauses) — they must
agree or the runtime reads a row the SQL never asked for. #572 was **BREAKING** for UUID-PK models:
`insert(uuid_model).execute()` returned `expected<int64_t>` (a meaningless `extract_int64` over a
TEXT/UUID column) and now returns `expected<void>`.

The same predicate answers **which PK can be an `ON CONFLICT` target** (#585) — a key is targetable
exactly when INSERT emits it, so it can actually collide:

| Key | In the INSERT? | Valid conflict target |
|---|---|---|
| single INTEGER (`AUTOINCREMENT`/IDENTITY) | no — DB generates it | rejected |
| single `storm::UUID` | yes — caller data (#565) | **accepted (#585)** |
| `primary_assigned` integer | yes — caller data (#586) | **accepted (#585)** |
| composite, full set in declaration order | yes — caller data (#502) | accepted (#503) |
| composite, strict subset | — | rejected (not unique alone) |

Before #585 this was gated on `has_composite_pk_`, whose justification ("INSERT omits a
single-column PK, so it can never conflict") had silently stopped being true for UUID keys at #565.

**Solved (#586)**: `storm::primary_assigned` declares a caller-supplied integer primary key.
Such a key is never DB-generated, so `insert()` emits the PK column and returns
`std::expected<void, Error>` (no `RETURNING`). The DDL is identical to plain `primary`
(`INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` on SQLite, `GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY` on PG) — the
distinction is on the DML side only.

**Foreign keys (#431)**: `[[= storm::fk<>]]` marks an FK field (bare = `RESTRICT`,
the SQL default — no `ON DELETE` clause emitted). The `ON DELETE` policy is the template
arg: `fk<RefAction::Cascade>` / `fk<RefAction::SetNull>` / `fk<RefAction::Restrict>` /
`fk<RefAction::NoAction>`. `SetNull` REQUIRES a nullable FK (`std::optional<Related>`) —
enforced at compile time by `ModelFkPoliciesValid<T>`. A class-template annotation (the flag
tag objects can't carry a parameter); FK detection runs through `meta::is_fk_field`. An FK target
must have a primary key: the `ValidForeignKey<FieldType>` concept (#474) constrains
`find_fk_primary_key` and the `FKFieldOf` gate on `join<>`/`left_join<>`, so a `join<>` on an
FK whose target lacks a PK fails at the call site (single-level — never recurses into the
target's own FKs). `ON UPDATE` is not emitted (identity PKs never change). See
[docs/guide/features/REFERENTIAL_INTEGRITY.md](docs/guide/features/REFERENTIAL_INTEGRITY.md).

**Many-to-many (#203)**: `[[= storm::many_to_many<>]]` (auto junction `<Owner>_<Related>`,
one junction table per field) or `[[= storm::many_to_many_through<Model>]]` on a container
member (`std::vector<T>`, `plf::hive<T>`, `vector<shared_ptr<T>>`). Not a column — invisible to
CRUD; eager-loaded via `join<fields::T.field>()`, several relations per call via
`join<fields::T.a, fields::T.b>()` (#392). The auto-junction `ON DELETE` defaults to CASCADE on both
sides, overridable via `many_to_many<RefAction::...>` (#431). See
[docs/guide/features/JOIN_OPERATIONS.md](docs/guide/features/JOIN_OPERATIONS.md).

**Reverse-FK (#398)**: `[[= storm::reverse_fk<^^Owner>]]` on a container member declares the
eager-load destination for "all `<Base>`, each with the `<Owner>`s that point at them". The argument
is the OWNER TYPE (resolved to its unique FK back at the base — the Base⟷Owner reference cycle forbids
a member splice in the annotation, so the owner must have exactly one FK to the base). Not a column.
`select()` runs the m2m two-query load (Q2 hits the owner table directly, no junction). Aggregate/filter
chains also accept a cross-model FK selector `join<fields::Owner.fk>()`, which disambiguates multiple owner
FKs (e.g. `fields::Bug.author` vs `fields::Bug.reviewer`). See
[docs/guide/features/JOIN_OPERATIONS.md](docs/guide/features/JOIN_OPERATIONS.md).

**Auto-timestamps (#209)**: `[[= storm::auto_create]]` / `[[= storm::auto_update]]` on a
`std::chrono::system_clock::time_point` field auto-stamp `now()` — `auto_create` on INSERT only,
`auto_update` on INSERT and UPDATE. **Bind-time only, no write-back** (the caller's object is never
mutated; re-SELECT to read the value). UPDATE preserves `created_at` by binding the object's stored
value, so pass the original `created_at` when updating. Zero cost on models without timestamp fields.

**No auto-timestamp on a primary key (#511)**: `auto_create`/`auto_update` on a PK member is a
**compile-time error** (`ModelTimestampPkValid<T>`, ANDed into the `BaseStatement` constraint list).
An auto-stamped key is rewritten by the statement matching on it — the #501 bug class, for the
implicit timestamp tail rather than the explicit SET targets. Detection routes through
`is_primary_member`, so it covers `primary`, `primary_autoincrement`, `primary_assigned` (#586),
and `primary_part` members — the path that was genuinely unprotected for composite keys was
`PrimaryKeyType` (#505) exempting `primary_part` entirely, which only blocked a single `time_point`
PK *incidentally*, by that type falling off the end of its integral/UUID whitelist. DECIDED
2026-07-29 in favour of rejection over silent exclusion, matching how #500 handles nullable and
relation-container PKs — breaking for out-of-tree models with that shape, of which there are none
in-tree. The `is_unlisted_auto_update` predicates in `update_grammar.cppm` AND `upsert_grammar.cppm`
also gained the `!is_pk_member` gate their four `is_settable_member` siblings already had; the concept
makes that gate unreachable (a model that would exercise it no longer instantiates `BaseStatement`),
so it is defence in depth only, retained against a future loosening.

**PostgreSQL integer column width (#603)**: `schema.cppm` picks the narrowest PG integer type
(`SMALLINT`/`INTEGER`/`BIGINT`) that safely holds a field's full C++ value range, instead of the
old uniform `BIGINT` for every integer-stored field — SQLite's dynamic-typing `INTEGER` is
unchanged (PG-only). A signed N-byte source needs a same-or-wider signed PG width; an unsigned
N-byte source needs one width class wider (its top half doesn't fit a same-width signed range), so
`short`/1-byte types → `SMALLINT`, `int`/`unsigned short` → `INTEGER`, `int64_t`/`long`/`long long`/
`unsigned int` → `BIGINT`. Enums and `std::chrono::duration` fields follow their underlying/`rep`
type (`integer_width_of<T>`, recursive one level). **A DB-generated single-column integer PK is
exempt** — `append_single_pk_column_def` hardcodes it to `BIGINT` (PG) regardless of the field's
declared C++ width (every in-tree model spells its PK as plain `int`), so anything that MIRRORS
such a PK — a junction side column, a composite-FK part column — must mirror that pinned width too,
not the width its own declared C++ type would otherwise get, or PG's `FOREIGN KEY` type check rejects
the `CREATE TABLE` (SQLite accepts the mismatch silently). Gated by `has_pinned_bigint_pk<Model>`
(`!has_composite_pk_ && !has_uuid_pk_()`, matching `append_single_pk_column_def`'s own condition,
cross-checked there by a `static_assert`) and `part_pinned_bigint<PartMember>` (the composite/
junction-part sibling, which resolves through the same single-level FK indirection
`pk_part_storage_type` uses). The per-field FK column (`append_fk_column_def`) mirrors the same pin
by construction rather than through these predicates — it already hardcoded `INTEGER`/`BIGINT` from
its own literal `fk_suffixes` lookup table before #603 and stays untouched, correct because that
table is reachable only for a pinned target. A composite or UUID PK is never pinned: its own column is already
width-derived from the same declared type a mirroring column resolves through, so both sides agree
by construction. **BREAKING** for any existing PostgreSQL database — narrower columns need a
migration, not just new schemas; accepted because no production Storm database exists yet.

**64-bit unsigned storage (#436)**: a bare `uint64_t` / `unsigned long` / `unsigned long long` field
is a **compile-time error** (`ModelStorageAnnotated<T>` constraint on `BaseStatement`). Annotate with
exactly one: `[[= storm::signed_storage]]` keeps today's signed `INTEGER`/`BIGINT` (byte-identical,
same `bind_int64`/`extract_int64` hot path, zero perf change) for values ≤ INT64_MAX; or
`[[= storm::full_unsigned]]` for order-preserving full-range `0..2⁶⁴−1` storage — SQLite zero-padded
20-char `TEXT` (lexicographic == numeric order), PG `NUMERIC(20,0)`, slower string bind/extract. Both
the `full_unsigned` bind/extract branches and the concept gate are compile-time-dispatched, so unrelated
types and signed-64/smaller integers are unaffected. Signed-64 types stay correct as `BIGINT`/`INTEGER`.

**Bounded text length (`max_length<N>`) (#493)**: `[[= storm::max_length<50>]] std::string name` bounds a
text column's length, **DB-enforced on every write path** — PG emits `VARCHAR(N)`, SQLite emits
`TEXT ... CHECK(length(col) <= N)` (both genuinely enforce; unlike Django/SQLAlchemy, whose `varchar(N)`
SQLite silently ignores). Class-template annotation `MaxLength<N>` carrying `N` as an NTTP (an enum member
can't be templated, same as `fk<Action>`), in the `field_attr.cppm` leaf module, re-exported to top-level
`storm::`. Only a text field (`std::string`/`std::string_view`/`std::optional<those>`) accepts it — a
non-text field is a **compile-time error** via `ModelMaxLengthValid<T>` (a `BaseStatement` constraint).
Nullable+bounded works: the SQLite CHECK passes on NULL. Combines with `unique`/auto-`DEFAULT` (#413)/
`indexed`; SQLite order: `<name> TEXT [NOT NULL] [DEFAULT v] [CHECK(...)] [UNIQUE]`. Detection helper
`max_length_of(member) -> optional<size_t>` mirrors `fk_on_delete_action_of`; the buffer grows via the
`ClauseSizer` sizer (`max_max_length_clause_len` folded into `regular_suffix`). No `min_length`/`check<>`
(separate follow-ups) and no client-side validation — the DB enforces.

**Field selectors — `fields::Model.field` (#518)**: the ONLY selector spelling. Both
predecessors are removed (BREAKING): `f<^^Person::age>()` is deleted, and a raw
`^^Model::member` in a selector position is a compile error. Declared per model in two
mechanical lines that name no fields, so they cannot drift:
`struct PersonT; consteval { std::meta::define_aggregate(^^PersonT, storm::field_specs_for(^^Person)); }
inline constexpr PersonT Person{};` — placed AFTER the struct, at namespace scope (a
`namespace fields` nested in an anonymous namespace makes every unqualified `fields::` in
that TU ambiguous), in a header that has `#include <meta>` and comes after `import storm;`.
`field_specs_for` emits ONE OF TWO proxies per member: a column (incl. FK) gets
`FieldRef<M>`, which derives from the stateless `where::Field<M>` and so inherits the whole
comparison surface — that inheritance is what makes the bare `fields::Person.age == 30`
work with no wrapper. An m2m/reverse-FK container gets `RelationRef<M>`, which has NO
`Field<M>` base and `= delete("...")`'d comparison operators: joinable
(`join<fields::Article.tags>()`) but never filterable, preserving #408 with an actionable
message instead of "invalid operands". Filtering THROUGH a relation is #553, not this.
`selector_info<S>()` recovers the `std::meta::info` at the API boundary; everything below
(statement classes, grammars, sizers) is unchanged `std::meta::info`. Generic code that
resolves a member by NAME (the YAML query builder) uses `selector_for<M>()`, the inverse,
since it cannot spell `fields::Model.member` for a template-parameter `Model`. `^^` remains
for DECLARATIONS — `storm_indexes`, `reverse_fk<^^Owner>` (names a type), `Indexes<>`:
**queries use `fields::`, model declarations use `^^`**. Destructuring a proxy works and is
arity-checked, but is POSITIONAL — reordering model fields silently rebinds with no
diagnostic. See [docs/guide/reference/FIELD_SELECTORS.md](docs/guide/reference/FIELD_SELECTORS.md).

**Entity concept (#472)**: `storm::meta::Entity<T>` is the compile-time structural gate for model
types — true iff `T` is a reflectable class (shipped as `std::meta::is_class_type(^^T) && requires
{ nonstatic_data_members_of(^^T, …); identifier_of(^^T); }`). `QuerySet<T>` and `BaseStatement<T>`
`require` it, so a non-model `T` (`int`, a pointer, a function type) fails at that named boundary
instead of deep inside reflection code. It sits ABOVE, and stays SEPARATE from, the semantic model
concepts (`ModelWithPrimaryKey`, `ModelStorageAnnotated`, `ModelFkPoliciesValid`) — those check model
*policy*, `Entity` checks *reflectability*. Structural only: a `union` also satisfies `Entity`, so
full model-ness is guaranteed by the semantic concepts together with it, not by `Entity` alone.

**Dialect-support concepts (#477)**: named backend-capability gates in `src/db/concept.cppm`
(`namespace storm::db`), replacing ad-hoc `if constexpr (requires { ConnType::trait; })` probes.
`SupportsPgDialect<ConnType>` (present iff the backend declares `uses_pg_dialect`) IS the
SQLite/PG dialect switch — true for PG, false for SQLite — used at `schema.cppm` (the `Dialect`
enum) and `base.cppm` (`append_order_by` NULLS FIRST/LAST). `SupportsLimitAll<ConnType>` is an
EXISTENCE probe true for BOTH backends; `append_limit_offset` still reads the bool VALUE to pick
`LIMIT ALL` (PG) vs `LIMIT -1` (SQLite). `TransactionCapable<ConnType>` names the
`in_transaction()`/`enter_transaction()`/`leave_transaction()`/`execute()`/`Error` surface that
`TransactionGuard` (#415) calls, and now constrains `TransactionGuard` + `storm::begin`/`storm::transaction`,
so a mis-typed connection fails at the `begin()` call site. NOT added: `SupportsRightJoin`
(`right_join()` was removed in #397 — no call site) and `SupportsReturning`/`SupportsStrictTables`
(declared on the connections but never read). Each backend static-asserts these next to its
`Connection` definition.

**ValidFieldInfo concept (#478)**: `storm::meta::ValidFieldInfo<MemberInfo>` is the compile-time gate
that a `std::meta::info` NTTP names a real field — `std::meta::is_nonstatic_data_member(MemberInfo) &&
std::meta::has_identifier(MemberInfo)`. It names the precondition the field selectors (and their
`Field`/`CollatedField` proxies) assumed inline, so a bad selector (a static member, a member function,
a whole-type reflection like `^^Person`, or `^^int`) fails at the named constraint instead of deep inside
`identifier_of`/`type_of`. Both requirements are load-bearing here (unlike `Entity`):
`is_nonstatic_data_member(^^int)` and `is_nonstatic_data_member(^^Type::static_member)` are both `false`,
so the concept genuinely rejects. Orthogonal to `Entity` (whole model type) and to `is_relation_field`
(the extra check excluding m2m/reverse_fk members from a column proxy — still ANDed at the call site).

See [docs/guide/reference/FIELD_TYPES.md](docs/guide/reference/FIELD_TYPES.md).

**PostgreSQL binary result format (#600 Phase 1)**: PG SELECT-shaped queries request libpq
binary result format — decoding network-byte-order bytes instead of ASCII-parsing text —
whenever every selected column is a plain byte reinterpretation (bool/int/int64/double/
float/text/blob), a compile-time whole-statement classification (`BaseStatement::
pg_binary_safe_row_`) since libpq's format flag is per-statement, not per-column. `DATE`/
`TIMESTAMP`/`UUID`/`full_unsigned`/FK members keep the whole statement on text, unchanged.
PG-only via an `if constexpr (requires { stmt->set_result_binary(bool{}); })` probe —
SQLite is untouched and the feature compiles away entirely there. Aggregates and
RETURNING-id paths are deliberately not wired (their PG wire types don't match what the
ORM extracts as; see the architecture doc). `storm_bench` has no PostgreSQL coverage yet
(#601), so the ~34% figure cited is from an isolated raw-libpq microbenchmark, not a
measured Storm result. See
[docs/internals/architecture/POSTGRESQL_BINARY_RESULTS.md](docs/internals/architecture/POSTGRESQL_BINARY_RESULTS.md).

## Known Compiler Issues

- **Module cache corruption**: Run build twice
- **`import std;` not header units**: the tree uses a single `import std;` (issue #326), NOT per-header `import <header>;`. Reflection code still needs textual `#include <meta>` (`import std;` doesn't export `std::meta::`), placed BEFORE the imports in non-module TUs. See [COMPILER_ISSUES.md §9](docs/internals/compiler/COMPILER_ISSUES.md) Findings A–D.
- **std::mutex in modules**: works via `import std;` (validated under TSAN). Per-thread connections are still the recommended concurrency model for QuerySet/Connection.
- **std::function errors**: Use abstract base classes
- **C headers / macros**: `<cassert>` (the `assert` macro) and POSIX headers (`<csignal>`, `<sys/*.h>`) must stay textual `#include` — `import std;` cannot deliver macros or POSIX extensions
- **Template alias can't be specialized**: `template<T> using X = Y<T>;` doesn't allow `template<> struct X<Foo>`. Use a real class template in a dedicated module to avoid circular deps.
- **No explicit specializations in multi-GMF headers**: an explicit specialization of a module-owned template (e.g. `Indexes<Person>`) in a header included by several module TUs' GMFs breaks with "reference to 'type' is ambiguous" once the import graph offers a second BMI path (#464). Use the nested-typedef opt-in (`using storm_indexes = std::tuple<...>;` inside the model) instead. See [COMPILER_ISSUES.md §11](docs/internals/compiler/COMPILER_ISSUES.md).
- **`if constexpr` in consteval loops**: `if constexpr(f(arr[i]))` fails even in `consteval` — loop variable `i` isn't a core constant expression. Use plain `if` (both branches must compile, but that's fine in consteval).
- **Compile-time errors: use `requires`, not `throw`**: `throw "msg"` in `consteval` produces a poor error message. Instead define a concept and constrain the template — the error fires at the call site with a clear constraint violation:
  ```cpp
  // ❌ Bad — throw fires late, poor message
  static consteval auto find_pk() -> std::meta::info {
      for (auto m : members) { if (is_pk(m)) return m; }
      throw "No primary key"; // NOSONAR needed, ugly error
  }
  // ✅ Good — requires fires at call site
  template<typename T>
  concept ModelWithPrimaryKey = []() consteval -> bool {
      for (auto m : std::meta::nonstatic_data_members_of(^^T, ...))
          if (is_pk(m)) return true;
      return false;
  }();
  template<typename T> requires ModelWithPrimaryKey<T>
  class BaseStatement { ... };  // constraint violation = clear error
  ```

See [docs/internals/compiler/COMPILER_ISSUES.md](docs/internals/compiler/COMPILER_ISSUES.md).

## Thread Safety

**✅ Safe**: Per-thread connections via `thread_local`
**❌ Unsafe**: Sharing QuerySet or Connection between threads

```cpp
// ✅ Safe pattern
void worker() {
    QuerySet<Person>::set_default_connection(":memory:");
    QuerySet<Person> qs;
    qs.where(age > 30).select();
}
```

**SQLite connection tuning (#410)**: `sqlite::Config` carries `busy_timeout_ms`
(default `5000`; `0` = legacy fail-immediately) and `journal_mode`
(`JournalMode::Default`/`WAL`), applied once in `Connection::open()` (cold path,
zero query-hot-path cost). `PoolConfig` propagates both to every pooled
connection via `detail::make_conn_config<ConnType>()` (an `if constexpr (requires
{ cfg.busy_timeout_ms; })` guard keeps it compilable for PG, whose `Config` is
just `StatementCacheConfig`). WAL is silently ignored on `:memory:`/temp DBs. See
[docs/guide/features/CONNECTION_TUNING.md](docs/guide/features/CONNECTION_TUNING.md).

## QuerySet API

**Immutable `where()`**: Returns a new QuerySet — the original is never modified (Django-style).

```cpp
// Fluent chaining
auto results = QuerySet<Person>()
    .where(age > 30)
    .order_by<fields::Person.name>()
    .limit(10)
    .select();

// where() returns a copy — safe to reuse base QuerySet
auto base = QuerySet<Person>();
auto young = base.where(age < 30);    // base unchanged
auto old   = base.where(age > 50);    // base still unchanged

// Scalar aggregates (no GROUP BY) → .get()
qs.count().execute();                          // int64_t
qs.sum<fields::Person.age>().execute();             // int64_t (0 over an empty set)
qs.avg<fields::Person.salary>().execute();          // std::optional<double> — nullopt over empty set (#416)
qs.min<fields::Person.age>().execute();             // std::optional<double> — nullopt over empty set (#416)
qs.max<fields::Person.age>().execute();             // std::optional<double> — nullopt over empty set (#416)
// MIN/MAX/AVG of no rows have NO value → std::nullopt, distinguishable from a real 0.
// GROUP BY MIN/MAX/AVG tuple columns are std::optional<double> too (NULL within a group).
// sum/avg/min/max require a NumericAggregateable target field (#475): arithmetic and
// not bool, one level of std::optional<> unwrapped (nullable numeric columns are fine).
// A string/BLOB/enum/UUID/temporal/bool field is a COMPILE ERROR, not a silent coercion.
// count()/count_distinct() are unconstrained — COUNT is type-agnostic.

// GROUP BY with aggregates → .select()
qs.group_by<fields::Person.department>().count().execute();

// HAVING (only with GROUP BY) — filters groups after aggregation
qs.group_by<fields::Person.age>().having(fields::Person.age > 30).count().execute();
qs.group_by<fields::Person.dept>().count().having(fields::Person.dept == "Eng").execute();

// DISTINCT
qs.distinct<fields::Person.name>().execute();

// Column projection (SELECT specific columns, duplicates preserved)
qs.values<fields::Person.name>().execute();                      // plf::hive<std::string>
qs.values<fields::Person.name, fields::Person.age>().execute();       // plf::hive<std::tuple<std::string, int>>

// JOIN — FK field selectors use reflection NTTPs like every other field selector
message_qs.join<fields::Message.sender>().where(...).select();
message_qs.left_join<fields::Message.sender, fields::Message.receiver>().select();

// Many-to-many (#203 model/schema; #391 two-query execution; #392 multi-relation)
// — container field annotated [[= storm::many_to_many]] (auto junction) or
// many_to_many_through<Enrollment> (explicit junction model). Eager load runs as
// Q1 (base entities) + one Q2 PER relation (owner_pk, related.*) WHERE owner_id
// IN (base subquery), stitched by one pk→entity hash map, all in one transaction.
// WHERE/ORDER BY/LIMIT apply to BASE entities. Cost per extra relation is
// additive (no cartesian product). 33-46% faster than the old 1-query 3-table
// join at fan-out >= 10. See docs/guide/features/JOIN_OPERATIONS.md#execution-strategy-391.
student_qs.join<fields::Student.courses>().select();      // students with courses aggregated
student_qs.left_join<fields::Student.courses>().select(); // + students with no courses
member_qs.join<fields::Member.courses, fields::Member.clubs>().select(); // several m2m in one call (#392);
// INNER drops members empty in ANY relation, LEFT fills each independently

// Conditional bulk DELETE (#198) — deletes rows matching the current where().
qs.where(fields::Person.age > 30).erase().execute();   // → std::expected<void, Error>
// Empty where() is refused (no full-table wipe); erase_all() is the explicit wipe.

// Conditional bulk UPDATE (#403) — SET columns are compile-time member NTTPs,
// values come from a prototype; FK cols emit <name>_id; auto_update auto-stamped now().

// Upsert (#205) — single-row INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (target) DO UPDATE / DO NOTHING.

// (compile-time checked — see the ON CONFLICT target table below).

// from the statement. Both terminals return void here (#572 — nothing to RETURN).

// insert<ReturnId::Yes> on a composite model is a compile-time error (ReturnIdSupported).

// Public transaction API (#415) — storm::begin(conn) returns an RAII
// storm::TransactionGuard<ConnType> (both re-exported from `storm`). BEGIN on
// begin(), explicit txn->commit(), auto-ROLLBACK on early return / throw / scope
// exit without commit. NEVER use raw conn->execute("BEGIN TRANSACTION"): chunked
// batch ops issue their own inner transaction and a raw outer BEGIN collides.
// The guard cooperates — begin() on an already-open connection returns a PASSIVE
// guard (no nested BEGIN; the outer guard owns the single commit/rollback),
// resolving the nested-BEGIN bug (#9). Nesting is tracked by a per-Connection
// depth counter (in_transaction()/enter_transaction()/leave_transaction()).

return txn->commit();                                  // → std::expected<void, Error>

// Scope helper storm::transaction(conn, body) — convenience layer over begin().
// body returns std::expected<T, Error>: a value COMMITs and is forwarded, a
// std::unexpected (or throw) ROLLBACKs and propagates. Same cooperative nesting.

**Methods**: `where()`, `join()`, `order_by()`, `limit()`, `offset()`, `group_by()`, `having()`, `distinct()`, `values()`
**Aggregates**: `count()`, `sum()`, `avg()`, `min()`, `max()`
**Transactions**: `storm::begin(conn)` → `storm::TransactionGuard` (RAII), or `storm::transaction(conn, body)` scope helper; both cooperative with batch ops (#415/#9)

## Testing

```bash
# SQLite + PostgreSQL — fast path, run the binary directly (~33s vs ~260s via
# ctest — see docs/internals/testing/TESTING.md#local-test-suite-speed)
STORM_PG_CONNSTR="host=/var/run/postgresql dbname=storm_db user=storm_db" \
    ./build/debug/tests/storm_tests

# Same, via ctest (slower; gives per-test filtering/listing via -R/-N). CI also
# uses ctest, but via `--test-dir` with its own connstr, not this preset.
ctest --preset ninja-debug

# SQLite only
ctest --preset ninja-debug-sqlite

# Filter specific tests
./build/debug/tests/storm_tests --gtest_filter="SelectTest.*"
```

See [docs/internals/testing/TESTING.md](docs/internals/testing/TESTING.md) for PostgreSQL test isolation details and the local test-speed findings.

### Thorough Testing Checklist

Every new feature or modification MUST include thorough tests covering these categories:

#### Expression/Filter Features (WHERE, HAVING, future clauses)
- **All 6 comparison operators**: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`
- **Special expressions**: `IN` (multiple values), `BETWEEN` (range), `LIKE` (pattern), `IS NULL` / `IS NOT NULL` (null checks)
- **Logical combinations**: `AND`, `OR`, complex nested `(A && B) || C`
- **Type coverage**: Test with int, string, double at minimum

#### CRUD Operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Single item operation
- Batch operation (multiple items)
- Batch at SQLite limit boundary (999 params)
- Operation on empty dataset
- Operation with all supported field types (int, string, double, bool, optional, blob)

#### Query Modifiers (ORDER BY, LIMIT, OFFSET, GROUP BY, DISTINCT)
- Modifier in isolation
- Modifier + WHERE
- Modifier + JOIN
- Modifier + WHERE + JOIN (all combined)
- Multiple modifiers together (e.g., ORDER BY + LIMIT + OFFSET)

#### Query Results
- Non-empty result set (happy path)
- Empty result set (filters exclude all)
- Single-row result
- Large result set (100+ rows)

#### Chaining & Caching
- Both chaining positions where applicable (e.g., `group_by().having().count()` AND `group_by().count().having()`)
- Repeated identical queries (statement caching correctness)
- Different queries on same QuerySet (cache invalidation)

#### Error Handling
- Invalid inputs where applicable
- Error paths tested via mock (test_orm_mock_errors.cpp pattern)

#### Cross-Backend
- Tests use TYPED_TEST with DatabaseTypes to run on both SQLite and PostgreSQL

## Python Bindings

```bash
cmake --preset ninja-python && cmake --build --preset ninja-python
PYTHONPATH=build/python/python python3 python/benchmark.py  # Performance comparison
PYTHONPATH=build/python/python python3 python/demo.py       # CRUD demo
```

**APIs**: `insert()`, `fast_insert(name, age)`, `fast_insert_many(names, ages)`, `bulk_insert()`, `select()`, `select_array()` (NumPy), `select_where()`, `count()`, `remove()`, `remove_all()`

See [python/README.md](python/README.md) for API docs, [docs/guide/features/PYTHON_BINDINGS.md](docs/guide/features/PYTHON_BINDINGS.md) for architecture, performance, and pitfalls.
