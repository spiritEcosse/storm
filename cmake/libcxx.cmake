# refuses to load the PCM with a "configuration mismatch / Reflection was
# disabled in precompiled file" diagnostic.
#
# Putting reflection flags inside apply_clang_flags() (target_compile_options)
# meant they didn't propagate to every PCM producer — most notably any
# auto-generated CMake-internal targets that build .pcm files. Promoting them
# here via add_compile_options() guarantees uniform reflection state across
