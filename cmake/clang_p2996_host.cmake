# cmake/libcxx.cmake (after project()) derives compile/link flags from

# directly, so its scenarios exercise the real production logic rather than a
# re-implementation of it.

# The Linux/Docker-built clang-p2996 (amd64) installs runtime libs/headers under

# build/include/<triple>/c++/v1) — a property of LLVM_ENABLE_RUNTIMES
# configuring more than one target. A native single-target build (e.g.
# macOS/arm64) installs flat, with no triple subdirectory. In practice this
# correlates 1:1 with host OS/arch for the two builds this project supports, so
# branch on host OS/arch — CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR isn't resolved this early
# (before project()), so shell out to `uname -m` instead — and then VALIDATE the
# resolved paths actually exist, so a real mismatch (e.g. a future single-target
# Linux build) fails loudly here instead of silently emitting dead -I/-L paths
# that clang would just ignore. _storm_host_arch may already be set by a caller
# (the test harness forces it, to exercise a host other than the one actually
# running the tests) — only shell out when it isn't.
